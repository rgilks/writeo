First of all, let us start with one of the most important things in our life and that is health. Our mind and body will be so much satisfied as we give our body at least the minimum of our time. What I am trying to say is that a certain form of physical activity per week is beneficial in many facets of our life. That is to say, If you lead an active life, your body appreciate it when you get older. On the other hand, those who prefer not to have an active life and their efforts to put their time in any kind of activity have a bad perspective when they get older. Moreover, their lifestyle is probably aimed to work and earning money.  All things considered, it seems reasonable to revise our free time and to think it over, if we have what we wanted.

There are a variety of transport systems available at the moment. For instance, we can travel on the railway, on the road, in the air and the last possible choice is under the ground.  That sounds good. We can travel anywhere and anytime we want. However, if we are want to be somewhere at a specific time and something has happened on our journey, what would we do?  Well, the solution is in science and the future. As I have read in the last six months, most of the companies have been trying to bring a solution to get somewhere faster than now. Any researchers brought fast trains and other fast cars. what is more, there is also a car that provides its passengers to get to the airport faster than by taxi. That is a car use a similar system as planes do, but for short distances. Maybe it is a future for the transport system in big towns. It does not produce any emissions lake carbon or sound.  As far as I am concerned, I guess that the future of transportation, let say travelling in the air is an issue number one. Finally, it seems reasonable to act for supporting science.

In fact, electric cars are at their apogee, so they can evolue in future energy that is more ecological, less and available. This is actually due to ecological factors and because of the breach of resources.    Secondly, because of the design of the cars, there is more technological aspect to cars and it might represent cars of the future.

As each of us remembers in the 19's we used to learn mainly from printed materials such as books. Our notes during the classes being made by a pencil. Those simple methods of education in schools have survived until now. It seems reasonable to say that there is no doubt that these fundamental things will be used by schools for the next decades.  In the last years, the development of the new learning methods in the field of technology is being implemented in schools and they are playing a key thing in education for the future generation. More and more students use their mobile phones, computers and similar tools to share information with others. Internet connection which is being widely spread, provide students immediate access to information they need. Even the students are absent at school, they can simply communicate with their teacher not to miss the class hours. The advantages stated above are playing an important role in implementing new technology at schools. On the other side, schools face many difficulties. There is a lack of money to make their future in education comes true. Lack of money slows down the whole process. Apart from educational institutions that belong to the government. If we want to move forward, we need to change completely the system of financing in the private sector.  The implementing of new technology will bring benefits for both the schools and the students. Now, we are balancing at the edge of the new perspective in education. In sight of the future, the schools will be able to offer virtual education. Additionally, students who suffer from different disabilities such as those who can not hear, or see anything would be able to participate as well. Moreover, thanks to science, students who suffer from disabilities would have the same chance to share the same class with students without these disabilities.

Firstly, we have to tell what sport we are talking here. When you are in a collective club sport like football or basketball, in most cases, even if you have only three training per week, you have to go to the match on the weekend, if you do skiing, you  have to go to the mountains and if you dance you have to be present in the evening events.

Firstly, I agree because it is a really good thing to have interest for school children health ! Especially because it train her to be disciplined, in fact, if they have to go to the sports three times per week, they are used to be present. Then, they have more responsibility, they know they have to do sport, and they know this is for their health. There is another point we can notice, in effect if they have to do sport, they become atheltics and then they are prepared physically.   Secondly, I don't agree because children have to realise their mistakes, so if we force them they lost autonomy, and this is the most important quality as an adult !   For me, sport have to be a choice, you can choose to do sport or be involved in your studies, eventually in spite of sport you can have an other activity, like a reading club or something else.

It might not happen by the first lie, but always if you overwrought something there are devastating consequences.    In my eyes, it is different. You should not tell everybody always the truth.

On one hand, competition is a basic way to persuade schoolchildren to care about their mental health and develop their ability to pick up information from different sources. Secondly, the middle-aged people prefer to increase their memory through reading and communication with others instead of using school methods of education. An appropriate way of education is to work in groups and communication which seems to be the most important.  As far as I am concerned, learning English as a second language offers both, verbal communication and studying. The importance is when you are trying to find a well-paid job, or want to travel. Secondly, learning languages bringing you a new level of positive thinking and expanding your memory needed when you get older.

The other way to improve it is to create appropriate books or online talk so students could learn from home. In the future textbooks will be replaced by personal computers, so you will not have to carry very heavy backpack. The scientists might also find a better system, how to comprehend the knowledge quicker. So, it will reduce years which we spend in school.

{"input": "Should computers and tablets completely replace books in schools and<U+00A0> universities? Write an **essay** giving your opinion.\n\nThere is a heated debate about whether schools and universities should replace printed materials by new technological inventions? Lots of surveys have been conducted among schools, showing the differences in using printed materials and technology. Results of these surveys were surprising. However, I am in two minds about it. On one hand, the first group included in the surveys were students. They prefer to use technology rather than books. The evidence is provided by their flexibility. For example, you can be online with your teacher when you are absent from school. Not to mention, looking for information on the internet, or share information among other students. Moreover, many printed materials do not need to be updated and that is why they would be provided via the internet. This solution does not seem to be such a big financial burden as buying new printed materials. On the other hand, teachers claim that most of the books need not be replaced by technology. These materials need to be updated. The second reason for this is the prices of implementing the new technology in schools which brings together other problems and take a long time to be fully effective. As far as I am concerned, we live in a new century in which technology is playing the most important role in many fields of education. That is to say, we can not avoid using new technology in our daily life. The technology eases our life in most aspects you think about.

There are few students who are satisfied in the classroom.  It seems that IT and AI will solve this problem. The AI could evaluate academic ability.

It has been supposed that children should do exercises three times per week or even more.

Nevertheless, I m a keen and probably already a professional climber, and in my best times, I trained four times per week. There can be no doubt that not every child can adopt these habits.

{"input": "Many people believe that it is important to always tell the truth. In your opinion, is it ever acceptable to tell a lie?<U+00A0> Explain your answer giving reasons and specific examples.\n\nIn my opinion, the topic is very complicated. On the one hand it is important to always tell the truth but sometimes there are situations when it's better to tell a lie.  Each issue is different and there is no universal solution to solve every case in a good way for both sides.  Telling the truth has both advantages and disadvantages. The biggest advantage is that you are being honest with yourself and what is more important, with the person who you talk to. On the other hand, the truth can sometimes be painful for the other person and many things can change in the relationship between you and he or she. But you can tell yourself that you said what had to be said and you won't be feeling guilty afterwards.  On the other hand, sometimes it's better to tell a lie. It is easier and can be less painful for the recipient but not for us. The worst part of telling a lie is that in most cases remorse can be unbearable and eventually we decide to tell the truth.

How do you feel about children playing video games? Give specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.\n\nThe popularity of video games among children has increased in recent years. To be more precise, children incline to the playing of video games instead of taking part in activities such as sport which is the key factor in their development. In a view of recent discussions, we can hear arguments that support the idea of playing video games. On the other hand, there are negative arguments as well. From my view, playing video games has a positive impact on children mind. To give an illustration, it supports their ability to react quickly on the situation by making an immediate decision. Secondly, they also develop their imagination in many situations and help them to solve problems such as school tasks. The negative impact of playing video games is described by parents as an inability to solve fundamental tasks relating to our daily life.

{"input": "Would you like to live a long, calm life until 100 years old or would you prefer a shorter life but much more intense. Decide and explain your reasons.\n\nEveryone has a dream to have a long and quiet life. People expect that the longer their lives become, the more peaceful their lives will be. However, I think that the opposite is true. I would like to describe my reasoning below. First of all, people need to prepare a lot of things if they live long, which usually requires tremendous burdens in advance. For example, many people are concerned about their future financial plans, especially after retirement, as the average life longevity has been extended more and more these days.   Second, there are quite a number of unexpected problems happening all over the world, such as natural disasters, and novel virus turmoil. This proves that the longer people live, the more they will encounter difficulties they cannot control on their own. As a result, it will be rare to find tranquil moments in their daily lives in such disastrous conditions. The last reason is that people never appreciate their precious lives, unless they utterly notice that the clock is ticking. To make the most of every moment, it is so much easier for people to have a short intense life, rather than long and calm one, which might unintentionally mislead that people they have tons of times left. For these reasons, I support the idea that a short but intense life is the better option in most cases.", "target": 8.0, "cefr": "C1+", "essay_id": "essay_ca517c4fcdf22d06", "split": "dev", "n_edits": 4.0}
{"input": "Many people believe that it is important to always tell the truth. In your opinion, is it ever acceptable to tell a lie?<U+00A0> Explain your answer giving reasons and specific examples.\n\nPeople have different opinions about the importance of telling the truth. Some insist that it is still acceptable to tell a lie, if necessary. However, I would like to counter this opinion. I will describe my reasoning as follows: First, although people believe that they are very good at hiding their actual feelings by telling a lie, what they think will be unconsciously delivered to the person they are talking with somehow. For instance, children sometimes express their feelings how much they hate their parents. However, deep down, they know their honest feelings are totally the opposite. This example is very straightforwad, but basic theory can be applied to any situation anyhow. Second, once people are used to tell lies to others without feeling guilty, it will easily become their second nature. This will mislead people into having doubts if others\u2019 opinions are trustworthy or not. Any relationship based on a firm trust is essential for any occasion, no matter with who you are at work, at school, or at home.  The last reason is that people often excuse their lies by saying that they protect other people from being hurt. This is simply because people do not try to be diplomatic enough to deliver their opinions. I am a strong believer that being a good communicator is a caring behavior to others.  In summary, for these reasons, I maintain that although we need to pay a lot of attention how to maintain good trust and relationship with others, we should be honest as much as possible.", "target": 7.5, "cefr": "C1", "essay_id": "essay_3e25bd4bbb166d6d", "split": "dev", "n_edits": 7.0}

{"input": "Your town council is thinking about banning the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants.<U+00A0> Write a letter to the town council giving your opinion about this and why you think it is or is not a good idea.\n\nDear town council,  I heard that there are intensive discussions among the town council members about banning mobile phone usage on public transportation, in shops and restaurants. I assume advantages and disadvantages of this plan have been thoroughly evaluated by experts. In conjunction with, I would like to express my strong disagreement with this plan as a tax payer, too.   To begin with, it is too drastic for people to adjust their current ways to work and manage daily activities if the ban comes into force. Communications on mobile phone have been inevitable social infrastructure for the past three decades. Without it, I think that productivity at work will be decreased, even though the ban is effective within limited areas.   Another reason is that people nowadays need to reach someone as well as to be reachable whenever they need from anywhere due to security reasons. For instance, parents, who are still heading back home on a commuter train, will be relieved when they receive a call from their children at home. Another example is that children, whose aged parents live remotely, will be seriously worried about the parents\u2019 health condition when their parents do not answer the cell phone, who might be simply eating out at that time.   Having said that, I maintain the idea that appropriate phone usage should be kept for good manners in public places. My suggestion is to introduce dedicated times and dates for specified places or zones where using mobile phones triggers server punishment.   I firmly believe that the idea of banning mobile phones in such areas is still not ready for the above reasons. It would be greatly appreciated if the council members would reconsider the plan.

{"input": "Some people believe that it is good for students to have the same teacher for several years. Others think students benefit more from having new teachers each year. Which do you think is better? Give specific reasons to support your opinion.\n\nThere are many arguments why people think that is beneficial for students to have the same teacher for several years. From the other view, people believe that having a different teacher at least each year is more productive and beneficial for students.  I am in two minds about that. Firstly, having the same teacher for several years gives more opportunity to know his students much better. If I take an example from my childhood, my teacher was deeply familiar with the problems I was having in my family life and how these problems contributed to my assessment at school. The communication between us has improved since the time. To be more precise, he knew how I was able to solve my tasks given by him. Last but not least, due to the fact, the teacher knew each student personally for many years, offers a variety of possibilities to deal with each other more completely.  From the second argument stated above, I would like to say that having a different teacher each year reduce teacher\u2019s chances to know his students better. In this case, solving problems with students usually put the teacher in a difficult situation because his personality would be different from what he thought about him. For example, if we do not know where the problems come from, we will usually find it difficult to give any support \u2013 in a roundabout kind of way. If I look on both sides, having the same teacher for several years seems to be the most persuasive argument. I completely agree with the statement that a teacher should have to know its students from both sides, which means personally and mentally. If there is no cooperation between a student and a teacher, we will not achieve any desired success or resolution we set before.", "target": 6.0, "cefr": "B2", "essay_id": "essay_46375c2a29996b40", "split": "dev", "n_edits": 17.0}

Firstly, music is not made to be a subject, but something outside school.  Usually, students listen to music on the trip to school and to their house, and after they finish their homework.  So, imagine that students associate music with school, it will stop to be something relaxing. For example, if a guy really hate school but loves music, and he realise that the subject of music isn't cool in school, he can imagine that it is the same in the professional world and stop his talent.  Secondly, if you absolutely want to teach music in your school, you have to make this subject attractive, and associate this class with something more fun than traditional lessons.  For the same example than the first part, if this student find this subject interesting, he can search pursuite of studying in music.

As a result, they prefer a shorter, more intense life a longer and calmer one. In the following text, I shall consider two arguments why everyone should choose a shorter one.  One point is you only live once. If you just spend your time with hanging around and relaxing, you will not experience something. When you are shortly before your death, it is better to say 'Wow, I made many experiences and although I haven't been living for a long time, I had a valuable life' than seeing nothing, isn't it?  Probably the most important argument is that a calming life cannot go along with a happy life. You should have your time to do what you like - no matter if you want to do sports, travel or go to work. Additionally, for reaching real happiness you need people you love like a family and friends. Having get to know these people, you must invest your free time for them, especially a family is very time-intensive.

Firstly, the tool Write and Improve is sectioned in four levels of progress from the beginner to advanced. A result of your hard work is awarded. The function of each award is your support to start a new writing task to reach the next award. Besides, the tool offers services like checking your writing by a teacher or participation in a class where you can provide your advice to other students. Simultaneously, you can share the task you created for others. Secondly, the tool Grammarly does not offer creating writing tasks or to answer them. This tool is completely different from Write an Improve. It can only check your writing and it offers you a correction of your mistakes. To use this tool more effectively is to make a setting for your writing goals. All things considered, as a result of my recommendation I would say the tool Write and Improve is much more useful for students of English at different levels. Conversely, Grammarly seems to be the most useful tool for those who use English in their work. For example, to write a business letter or write an essay on a topic you want.

By and large, your monthly income must cover all needs of your life such as travel to school, food, household. Conversely, those who decided to stay with their families while studying do not need to prioritize their budget as those who live on their own.

No more issues with timings and  schedules. Not only is the service custom tailored and available 24 hours a day, but it also gives you a feedback in a blink of an eye.  What I find less appealing though, relates to its useage on mobile phones, which I find slightly old style and uncomfortable.

However, I was on holiday for three weeks with my new girlfriend. You asked me in your last letter about a review of a movie I love the most. Well, the film was written by well-known filmmaker Clint Eastwood. The movie is called the Letters from Iwo Gima. It is about ordinary men who were sent to fight in a none sense war. On one side, many of them died on the battlefield. On the other side, lots of them committed suicide. The key point of the story is, before they died, everyone wrote letters to their family members, relatives or loved once. These letters had never been sent off. Instead, they have been hidden in the caves on the island and found after 50 years. Clint Eastwood wrote the movie based on those letters.  It is a real story that makes you feel whit those soldiers who died in a terrible war.  I do hope you will be amazed by the story and reality that comes from the letters.

Do you agree? Write your **argumentative essay**.\n\nUnhealthy lifestyle has began to influence the life of the students both at university and school. One of them is inactive lifestyle. It indeed brings severe impacts on the students' lifestyle. Several efforts have been proposed as one of them is forcing them to do sports activities at least 3 three times in a week. However, would it create such an impact?  First of all, doing exercise is beneficial for the body as it can bring positivies to the students and improve them physically and mentally. However, bear in mind that every student has its own right for its own body. They can do whatever they want with their bodies as they can choose whichever lifestyle they are going to implement as the responsibilities are on them. Forcing them contradicts to their rights of their body autonomy. Therefore, Encouraging them to do sports would be better than making it mandatory.  Second of all, healthy lifestyle is not all about physical activities such as do sports or exercise. Doing sports is not the only one in order to have a healthy life. There are many other activities that can have the students to reach healthy life such as diet, food choices or meditations. Therefore, sports activities are not the only actions school can take but educating them to be healthy is also one the solutions.   Third of all, it is irrelevant to force the students to do sports three times a week. The healthy lifestyle is not defined by quantity of exercises in a week done by a person. But it is more to the quality of the exercise. It would be less relevant to have exercise for three times in a week without having a good quality of activities than just once with impacts to the students. Besides, the students are generally busy with their own courseworks and extracurricular activities as it becomes a hindrance for them to do exercise if it is being upheld.  In conclusion, forcing students to do sports every week might bring good impact on them. However, it contradics to their rights and potentially impedes their activities. Encouraging them to do exercise is actually more preferred than making it compulsory.", "target": 6.5, "cefr": "B2+", "essay_id": "essay_406509ea6b2b3955", "split": "dev", "n_edits": 27.0}

I have a distinct pleasure to write this letter with the intent of expressing my candid insight into the ban on mobile phones on public transportation and public places.   My life experience enabled me to conclude that material possessions offer temporary solace; due to my perseverance in self-improvement and investment in my education. I broadened my perspective to the point of being able to shift dramatically from materialistic to spiritual.  This spiritual awakening enabled me to become successful in determining the right and wrong aspects of human activity.   Never have I been more convinced of the detrimental effects of mobile phones on human well-being than in current reality, when our society is facing the unprecedented spike in mental health issues, single-person households, divorce rates, addictions, broken homes, and suicide rates, not to mention security concerns related to mental exhaustion that prompts hazardous behaviors in humans.   Moreover, a national inquiry into effects of mobile phones on toddlers aged one to three years old carried out in 2006 by the National Institute of Science reveals that pupils engaged in online activity for more than two hours a day demonstrate shorter brain wawes compared to their counterparts who were not exposed to such stimulation. Additionally, the first group reports a considerable increase in self-esteem and academic achievement.    For this reason, I urge you to implement the prohibition on mobile devices in public facilities.  Should any additional detail be required, I would be delighted to provide more information backed by in-depth scientific insights to support my theory.

It gives you the freedom of discovering sides of you that you didn\u00b4t know of. Some of them you will enjoy and some of them you won\u00b4t, but you can work on those that you didn\u00b4t like and make a better version of yourself.But there will be also the feeling of loneliness, especially in the first months. The knowdledge among with it adventure is also a huge experience. The school\u00b4s structure and the educational system will be different from what you were used to and you will have to adjuste yourself in this whole new world. The school\u00b4s colleagues will be probably from different countries. So, the challenge of living together with people from different countries gives the opportunity of facing different opinions, cultures and  habits. This will give personal and professional growth. There is also the big opportunity of being fluent in a new language. This will improve your resum\u00e9 and you will be a footstep ahead on the journey of finding a job.", "target": 6.5, "cefr": "B2+", "essay_id": "essay_931302964fa14334", "split": "dev", "n_edits": 16.0}

{"input": "Would you like to live a long, calm life until 100 years old or would you prefer a shorter life but much more intense. Decide and explain your reasons.\n\nLife is a precious gift given to us by God. Life span of any human being is unpredictable. Some people live a long life while others enjoy a short span in this world. It is a great experience to lead a long life, but I believe quantity of life should have less weightage than the quality of time spent. It is undoubtedly true, people who are living their life to the fullest are the happiest. Also, they are not dependent on others for financial or physical support in their lifetime.  Firstly, it is important to be happy and healthy throughout life. People who have less expectations, like a long life will try to live the time intensely following their dreams and experiencing happiness. For instance, going for vacations and travelling around the world frequetly in younger age present the feeling of excitement and energy in life, which can prove to be a stress buster and make a person happy.  Secondly, living a short and fulfilling life gives the feeling of satisfied life. It is always encouraging to have a life which is not dependent on anyone else either financially or physically. To illustrate, human body starts deteriorating after a certain age and thus, needs support for performing day to day activities, the person also becomes incapable of earning and is interdependent, which can inculcate the sense of loneliness in life.  In conclusion, it is like two swords in a case. People living a long life can earn many relationships and experience the change in generations throughout their life span, whereas the one with short and lively life can live his/her life independently to the fullest. Therefore, it is in my opinion that shorter and fulfilling life is better than a calm long life.", "target": 8.0, "cefr": "C1+", "essay_id": "essay_34469d04cb0e78d6", "split": "dev", "n_edits": 12.0}

In my opinion, there is always good and bad in everything, maybe not in equal parts but still.   Nowadays children quite no longer play outside in the playground. Forced by situation, video games may be one of the fewest opportunities for children to play and do it with others.  Obviously, children tend to spend lots of time with computer games, therefore parents are required to watch over them and be the time-keeper. If children are allowed to spend a certain time-frame to play and if parents check carefully what their children play, video games are not that bad. Children can learn strategy as well as team working and last but not least they can easily learn English since most of the video games are released in English.  As far as I can say, I am pro video games, as long as children are not left alone and unguarded. In such a case, video games can do more harm than any other games.

What do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of studying abroad?\n\nIn recent years some students, attending high school or university, decide to study some time in a foreign country instead of studying at home. As far as I can say it is a choice that weighs for better or worse in their future life with probable repentance if not taken in time  Although nowadays it seems to be an easy choice to take, deciding to study in a foreign country is not that simple. First of all we have to consider the costs, quite high; secondly the psychological impact has a great component in the final result: students have to adapt to a new life and at the same time to attend the school, hopefully, with good outcomes, not an easy situation to cope with.   On the other hand, the possibility to study abroad represents a great opportunity that someone shouldn't miss. Learning a foreign language in the origin country is much better than studying it in another place, it gives the opportunity to improve it day-by-day with live language and apprehend at the same time the local way of living, a good start, envisioning to live abroad in the future.  In conclusion, I think that the decision of studying abroad for some time, despite costing quite a lot of money, is  a positive choice even just to consider the broader options of future jobs.

It sounds like a Shakespearean dilemma. Let's take a closer look at the issue.   It has to be considered that in the current times of social media, everybody's image of a fulfilled life may get blurred or even distorted. A significant fraction of people has experienced the FOMO syndrom, some may have fallen a victim to depression. Both as a consequence of feeling a lack of meaning in the life, according to psychologists.  Even though this knowledge does not resolve the issue, it is a crucial prerequisite for finding the core of the matter.  Neither the length, nor the intensity of life guarantee the personal feeling of satisfaction due to the fact that they do not equal any meaning. The former should be disregarded in the first place, as it is a significant figure after one's death. During their lives, people do not consider it.  The intensity being mentioned, it can be generally assumed that exciting experience may bring a cetrain sense of fulfillment, nonetheless, it has been proven that calm activities, such as meditation, increase one's contentment dramatically.

It's a difficult thing to approach because you need student if you want to maintain this type of subject in school but you also cannot force students from informatics specialization to do it. A solution could be to implement a different type of stuying class. A teacher could be paid to have some classes during the week and every student from every class or grade could attend. In this way we can satisfy the lack of students and the teacher could teach with entuziasm.  I think that students could develop great skills by learning to sing at an instrument. I saw a lot of people who developted a good thinking by learning to sing at some instrument. They where literally learning easily everything at school.

{"input": "In some offices, employees work in enclosed workstations or cubicles. Other offices have a more open design, in which there are no walls separating employees from their coworkers. Which type of arrangement do you think is most effective? Explain, giving reasons to support your answer.\n\nIn general office spaces are designed to match the room or the building bought or rented to work, they are generally not thought in advance. The result is that some working spaces end up to be smaller than a closet some others turn out to be dispersive.   In my opinion, the least effective arrangements between the two is the first one: working in a tight space, sometimes with not even the natural daylight, risks to undermine firstly the employees' mood and secondly their health in general. For instance keeping in the same room, computers, printers and workers can render the whole space too hot and too noisy, therefore not the ideal working place . Another aspect to consider,  in separated offices, are the reduced exchanges amid colleagues, this might limit the leverage of the team building culture. I would say that this kind of office arrangements might be fine only if the secrecy is the priority for working purposes.  I would definitely prefer working in a wide open space where interactions among co-workers are  facilitated. The absence of walls is certainly a good choice in an office to foster a cooperative community as such, in an open space, in case of problems, assistance among colleagues is easier and in addition information runs faster than in separated rooms so that everyone in office is informed about what it is going on. Open spaces help as well to create a friendlier working environment which enables workers to be at ease and contribute in a more positive way to the firm objectives.  In conclusion, although little spaces or separated spaces may respect the privacy of workers , in an open space, once more, I do believe that either the workers as well as the firm itself benefit of the arrangements in terms of results and wellbeing.

One tablets can store as many books as a bid library does. Second, students can find the books in tablets faster 100 times than finding the books in libraries.

They can see what workers doing and the workers see their managers too, as the result workers will forcus on their works and produce more products. Scond, the workers of company easily contact with other workers to have more help. It will contribute the team work and built the culture of the company.

{"input": "Most medical doctors want to work in cities where they will make a lot of money. Yet in many rural areas there are not enough doctors. What are the reasons for this problem? How can it be solved?\n\nThe medical profession should be a vocation , despite this starting point,  some doctors prefer choosing to work in big cities to gain a much higher salary. Due to this attitude, many places in the countryside  suffer a shortage of medical doctors.  It is understandable that after many years of studying for the medical profession, most doctors believe the recovery of the money spent  is something they deserve. They therefore tend to look for a job in cities where they will be able to gain better working conditions in terms of money and career. Nevertheless money should not be placed on top of the reasons to practise this noble profession: the idea of being helpful to others or aiming to find, on day, a new cure to an old disease should be the real push to start this profession.   Instead, based on what was highlighted above, as a consequence, in many rural areas, doctors seems to be a rarity. Mostly in little villages up in the mountains, the risk of having only one doctor to serve a very wide area is quite common nowadays. Logically, living in the mountains or in the countryside is less comfortable than in a city. With that said, to try and balance this situation, major fringe benefits should be foreseen in these areas in order to render more appealing these locations for the doctors. For instance, a house or car should be added as additional gifts, maybe a preferential lane for a faster career as well might be helpful.  Doctors are really important in all our lives and we all should spend more time in thinking how to improve their working conditions in the pursuit of diminishing the risks to lose these professionals not only from the rural areas but also from the country itself.

To develop physicque, human need to do activities such as running, walking, climbing, working, etc. but to develop mental human need to study including studying music. Second, studying music will help one understand the msic notes. Music notes simulate different tone of voices and divided into 14 different frequencies. Each person can rewrite his tone by himseft and he can compose a song after studying music. Third, studying music will help developing human's brain completely.

I believe that this is a fair and important step for the students and their growth, emotionally and professionally speaking.   This requirement can certainly help students to better understand the real world outside the school environment . To most of them, first of all, it might give  the opportunity to really get in touch with other realities, sometimes very different from their families and their usual way of living. Secondly they can have a sample of the job's world with all its duties and responsibilities. Besides they might as well decide that it could be the job they would like to do in the future as a living. For example, they could volounteer in a kinder garden and then realize that  taking care of the children is what they have always dreamt of. For the same reason, they could find out that helping old people in their daily routine might be what they want to do for a living.  Although they are not paid for this kind of activities, I strongly believe that thanks to the volounteer work they will receive much more in terms of learning and formation.

Another example will be something involving the national security. If the government asks you to lie, you better do it.

Music as a school subject or  how to learn and play an instrument is compulsory in a few schools while in some others, students are not required to do so. I think that music should always be added as subject to learn in each school at any level being far important to the emotional growth of scholars and as alternative way of learning about history.  Just to give an example, learning about the history of music may give the students the opportunity to know about a part of human evolution. If you name, for instance, the period of romanticism , studying Wagner could make them understand the vision of the intellectuals in the nineteenth century.  In addition , learning how to play an instrument can definitely help the development of a manual intellegence as well as a sensitive one in most of the students. Although listening to music can be relaxing, learning how to play it  might become a more effective tool to use when you need to get rid of the stress.  In my view, I wish to underline again the importance of studying music as a school subject at any degree as it will enrich the students' inner world then it will broaden their emotional horizon and in the end, it will add another way to communicate: Music is absolutely another language which can easily talk to heart and soul.

In my opinion, I think it is not a good idea because of some reasons bellow: First, today mobile phones are the smart phones. People use smart phones for many purposes such as working, sudying, communicating, etc. Many people do not finish their works before going home and they have to work on the way home. They have to use mobile phones to continue their work. I have applied for this job for 6 months and I have to study more to increase my knowledge and I often use my mobile phone to study the online course on the way going home. I have to save every minute. If the town councile bans using mobile phones on public transport, how could I study any more. I knew that many young people use their mobile phones to study their additional courses in free time. Second, online payment is developing very fast, many people use mobile phones to pay their bills when shopping. I knew that our government encouraged people to use electronic payment. it helps the economic system more transparent. If the town council bans using mobile phones in shops, people have to use cash for their payment and the policy of using online payment of government cannot be conducted. I am a responsible person and I find my responsibility for our country. I would like to recommend that the town council should not isue that ban.", "target": 6.5, "cefr": "B2+", "essay_id": "essay_100639adbe54b00c", "split": "dev", "n_edits": 15.0}

The animals are kept in an environment as much alike as the natural area that they would be living, but this does not mean that they are living as they should be. It\u00b4s because they are living in a limited area, not surrounded by other animals or plants that would be their meal. All that they eat are easily given and they do not have to work to get it, so they easily become more domesticated. It\u00b4s not just because of this fact, but they are also more used to live around humans. These all make them become more distant of what an animal like them should be. No one likes being encaged because it takes us the freedom that we are so willing to chase for. If we, humans, don\u00b4t enjoy it and we are most used to be enclosed in places like our homes, imagine what it would feel for an animal that are used to live in an unlimited environment like the jungle.

The volunteer work that is made by teenagers could provide them with true knowledge which they could use in their real lives, for example when you work preparing food for poor people, this work gives you two benefits, one the kitchen lessons and the other could be a different perspective of our society.  On the other hand, we have to be careful about the situations that our teenagers are exposed, for instance if they are not under super the supervision of an adult they could harmful relations with people that should receive the volunteer work, for example if they are working some drug dealer could offer them drugs.

How can it be solved?\n\nThere is a heated debate for many years on the availability of medical care in rural areas. Many doctors left these areas to provide medical in big cities. What is more, those who were old had retired. If this trend continues, the situation will not be sustainable.  Furthermore, it might soon result in a phase that rural areas lost the ability to provide medical care to the same extent it was before. To solve that problem, we have to deal with arguments that cause this lack of medical care. Let us unpack some of them. Lack of financial sources is one of them. A regular income provided to doctors in rural areas is not so efficient to cover all services linked to providing medical care. Secondly, another reason is the attractiveness of the location where we want to invest in medical care. Lack of infrastructure, for example. The infrastructure and transportation system is playing an important role. If we take it seriously and tackle that problem successfully, we have to provide a proper background.

We see accidents related to smartphones in the news every day and many people injured are kids. The city halls of many towns have the idea of banning the use of smartphone while the pedestrians are walking, this is a way to stop this kind of accidents and save many lives, but this idea was very controversial when it was launched. To begin with this idea, we can reduce the number of dead in city centers, for instance if you don't see to both sides of the street while you are writing a message a car could hit you. Maybe you don't die in this accident but you could spend months in the hospital.  Secondly, we have the money idea, for example when there is an accident we use a lot of money repairing cars, sidewalks and urban furniture, besides the salaries of workers, doctors, policemen, firmen, etc. With this law we will be able to use the taxes in better things and not in repair streets. The last year we spent three millions of euros in my town because of the car accidents, if we had not had many accidents we would have used the money in other issues.

Do you agree? Write your **argumentative essay**.\n\nDuring the last 10 years, university students and school children have changed their way of playing and spending their spare time  gaining new unhealthy habits. Younger generations have been starting to spend lesser time outside than the older ones, preferring playing computer games or simply watching television rather than thinking of a game to do outside such as playing hide-and-sick or playing football or even simpler just take a short walk.   Not playing often outside, spending instead most of the time sat on a chair or on a sofa, the bad result on their health has started to show heavily. In order to avoid worse consequences on the adult life, doctors and health experts would suggest forcing them to do any physical activity at least three times a week. I definitely agree with this suggestion.  I believe that children, teenagers and young adults should be educated in a new culture for a healthier body by drawing their attention to the sports activities and besides this, I would add as well, the stress on a healthier diet would not do any harm.  Whatever kind of physical or leisure activity  which involves mouvements would fit perfectly with this new kind of education. Therefore not only taking a swimming course or a football training, but also taking the stairs instead of the elevator, going to school on foot or by bike instead of by bus or by car, could be a good start towards the right direction to improve the bad unhealthy habits.  Parents should help their children in this task as they look at us as an example, always. However the frantic modern life can sometimes  refrain us from taking a healthier behaviour because it could look like  more difficult. As long as we, as adults, do not change our static lifestyle, we will not be able to push our children to explore new healthier habits.

{"input": "Some university students move away and live on their own while they are attending school, but others live at home with their family while they are students. Which do you think is a better choice? Give reasons to explain your answer.\n\nStudying at university is an important choice in life and as a consequence, in relation to the chosen school, it is sometimes necessary to move from home. Some students decide then to leave home and stay on their own while some others choose to stay by their families.  The first decisive factor, establishing whether to stay with parents while studying at the univesity or to leave home, is the economic aspect which most of the times determines as well the choice of the univerisity to attend.   In my opinion, I would suggest staying home with parents  so that students could totally dedicate their time to study instead of trying to  balance school and job. Thinking just about the school may help to get over the university in due time and obvisouly by respecting the timetable, it results in an additional cost saving.  On  the other hand, if students decide to leave home and live by themeselves while studying, they have first of all to consider the additional cost of a rented apartment. They need then to start thinking of their life as an adult one with all its consequeces. For example, they definitely need to look after their new house, think on how to arrange the daily routine such as shopping for meals or cleaning the house. All actions that take time from their studies. In addition, should they need to look for a job to gain a living, they will have lesser time for school. In some cases, this situation can lead the students to withdraw from  university.     At the end, I strongly believe that the best and the most effective way to study at the University is to choose a school not very far from parents' home in order to stay with parents and dedicate all the energy towards the successful conclusion of the school career.

That\u00b4s a thought a little harsh to seek and to believe in as well, but unfortunately it is a common belief among adolescents and young adults. The entire journey needed to make that ultimate choice shouldn\u00b4t be dealt with so much severity.

That decision is susceptible to changes.The schools and all the professionals inserted in this world don\u00b4t offer to the students the correct tools needed to make such an important decision like a phychological assistance and a certain transparency of all the obstacles that they will face along the construction of their professional lives. The problems are even beyond this flaws in the educational system. Nowadays, the teenagers don\u00b4t have enough patience to pursue greatness, because to achieve that level of success takes a lot of effort,commitment and a certain resilience when nothing is working out. There is also the error of judment that greatness and success should come along with mountains of money and recognition.

When they are looking for success and a faster way to earn money, they all think that there is one way to accomplish it that is being a doctor. The unhappy reality is that they are right. Medical doctors who have just graduated earn more money than any other professional. This eager search for richness become their main purpose on their professional lives and they forget about the ultimate vow that they have made at their graduation. They should assistance and provide medical care to those places where is needed and to whoever is claiming for help. They shouldn\u00b4t be moved by greed, but by humanitarianism and sympathy. This is a current issue that  just can\u00b4t be fixed rapidly, it takes a lot of commitment and planning mostly by the government and the educational system.

Those characteristics remind him of a safe place and because of that, he will be more open and free to be himself out of the looks, pressure and critical expressions and words of his co-workers. This private area will relax him enough to induce his criativity and productivity. The results of an enclosed workstation will appear at the quality of the work presented by the employees and also at the amount and agility of the tasks done by them daily.On the other hand, those offices with open design don\u00b4t have walls that can provide privacy to the employees. The privacy that comes with the walls offers a distance from the pressure caused by critical looks from co-workers and also offers a certain sound barrier between them. The lack of sound barrier is probably one of the main reasons why workers get so distracted during their daily work. When you are at an environment that you don\u00b4t feel comfortable enough to do your job, it can be quite challenging to achieve your level of concentration to start a task. When you finally got back on track, someone starts talking on the phone or with someone near you. That action disturbs anyone, even the most focused person and you will get a hard time trying to keep going with your work. Even though when those conversations are over, you will spend another few minutes to get back to the rhythm and the level of concentration that you were before you were interrupted. Those precious minutes stolen from you daily due to the loss of focus, will certainly affect not just your productivity and quality, but also the entire office.

{"input": "In some schools, students must study music and learn to play a musical instrument. In other schools, studying music may not be required or there may be no music classes at all. Do you think all students should have to study music? Support your opinion with reasons and examples.\n\nIn every corner of the world, there is someone who knows a talented person who could have been an incredible professional if it was given him the opportunity to develop this gift. It is known that it\u00b4s never too late to accomplish great things, but in some areas this truth it is not applied like in the world of the sports. Even though some people take that statement as a mantra in their lives, others think that those words belong only to a fairy tale world. These ones don\u00b4t think that the option to dive in to a new profession and leave behind years of commitment and dedication to their current profession it is a valid one. I can\u00b4t blame them because the unknown can be really terrifying and this fear may be bigger than the wish to feel connected to their inner truth. Sometimes when a talent is discovered later in life, it can be more a curse than a gift because this person will be suffering from all that he could have done with it. He will regret it, will find someone to blame and maybe will feel bitter for the rest of his life. We are often wasting thousands of talents because we don\u00b4t offer the opportunity to each one of them to find out their calling. One solution to this error could be corrected through programs at schools. Schools need to offer to the students diverse programs of dance, sports, music and other areas so that they can choose themselves in which one they are more connected and comfortable on doing it. Those programs should be a part of their educational system as an obligation subject. At that age, adolescents and children have to be sometimes encouraged to make a move because science already confirmed that the part of our brain related to making decisions it is not fully developed until 18 years old. That being said, all the students should experience all kinds of classes like music classes. If they found out during those periods that they don\u00b4t have the talent or they don\u00b4t want to pursue it in their lives, they can bring this new ability to their daily lives as a hobby. Music is always welcomed in anyone\u00b4s lives. Music can give us peace of mind, change our mood, increase our concentration and help us to overcome and release a feeling that has been harming us and jeopardizing our growth. Everybody should have the opportunity to know how to play an instrument or how to sing and the best period to introduce it is at school.", "target": 8.0, "cefr": "C1+", "essay_id": "essay_adad4300c366a626", "split": "dev", "n_edits": 14.0}

But let's look at the different side.If you are very wealthy but not healthy,you still can recover by eating pills and resting.After all,money can particularly buy anything.Except money,people,and time.So the statement'It is more important to be healthy than to be rich.'is partly not true.", "target": 6.0, "cefr": "B2", "essay_id": "essay_de345e480348d9f7", "split": "dev", "n_edits": 32.0}

So, personally speaking, I can't agree with this idea.  First and foremost, mobile phone is benefit to us, we can use it to contact with our parents, and play games to unwind us, I know there are many debates about how the mobile phone should be banned, my opinion is absolutely not. As I said, mobile phone is benefit to us, but try to transpositional consideration, you may discover that prople can't leave the mobile phone anymore, if the mobile phone was banned in the public areas, the individuals can't ring others, or get some information in time, and the time also becomes difficult to control.  Additionally, mobile phone may do harm some people, they decrease the relationship between the family, and make people become estranged from each other. However, it is not the mobile phone's faults, but the way to use them, and I think the town council should lead people use it in a correct way, but not banned it in public areas, this method will sharpen contradictions, and make the situation worse, even destabilize society.

Decide and explain your reasons.\n\nFor some people it may not be a compete rocket science however some may wrap their head around this question I'm about to present. Would you rather live a long calm life or would you prefer short but intense life instead? Let's dive into that... On one hand we have long peaceful life, which I bet many introverts would according to studies choose over chaotic intense life. Life full of happiness, friends or even family. Sounds like a dream come true, doesn't it? Have you ever wondered though what you'd do with this long period of time in your hands? Your life might get bored after a while not doing anything exciting.  On the other hand however we have short yet more intense life full of adventure, memories and good laughs. This option sounds more appalling to outgoing and sociable people. There are cons to this option for certain and it's up to every single one what seems more likeable to them. I, personally, would without a doubt choose the second option being shorter yet more intense life. I'm aware nobody specified the exact period of time I'd get to live, nonetheless picturing myself siting on sofa maybe rading a book for perhaps 60 years seems like a waste of my time whereas adventures even small ones for instant simply appeal more exciting and I desire a life where I can turn back to see what I happened to achieve or simply look back with a smile on my face knowing I have done everything I'd wished for.

{"input": "In some offices, employees work in enclosed workstations or cubicles. Other offices have a more open design, in which there are no walls separating employees from their coworkers. Which type of arrangement do you think is most effective? Explain, giving reasons to support your answer.\n\nAs you know arrangement of your office at the workplace you work in is playing an important role. Moreover, it also has an impact on your feelings, communication with your colleagues and mind. In the first group, you can find workers who prefer to be in closed and separated areas equipped with no special furniture. However, they put a lot of effort to arrange their offices in a simple way but in the spirit of the latest design and modern furniture to feel much more comfortable. To be more precise, they prefer their offices with daylight from the outside through the windows. From the above, we can understand that those people have a weakness for presenting well-being. They also like small and well-organized places where all things have their own place. In addition, they must visually present their success in the way to show their awards and diplomas on the walls of their offices.  The other group of workers tend to have simply arranged offices with no special design. Those offices usually have a purposeful arrangement. By and large, simple arranged office dominates. Notably, places for others who come in to discuss a problem or even participate in a meeting is not missing. Conversely, those places in which workers spend at least eight hours per day would be comfortable. For example, their workplaces are equipped with places where people can meet and have a short break for discussion.  In my view, the second example of an arranged office seems to be the most persuasive. To clarify my opinion, I am a person who loves to be surrounded by positive and communicative people sharing their ideas. If someone asks me what I would suggest having in my office, I would say nothing special \u2013 in a roundabout kind of way. Last but not least, the more effort you put into the design of your office the comfortable you will feel there.

{"input": "Some high schools have a requirement that students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate. What do you think about this type of requirement? Give details to support your opinion.\n\nThese days we are witnessing heated debates about students volunteer work. Students in high schools had to make their commitments to undertake a certain amount of hours of volunteer work to graduate. To be more precise, they were given a chance to choose one from the school\u2019s offer. There were counted around 100 volunteer works positions available. However, many of them had to turn a blind eye to this requirement and say it is not by school standards. There are two sides of the coin. On one side, it is obvious that in some countries we can find schools aimed at practical use. To give an illustration, plant growing and other manual works needed to be practised. In fact, to receive a certificate of qualification. As a final stage of your education, you will be asked to undertake a test or an exam to show your gained knowledge at a certain level. On the other side, some schools are not aimed at education included manual or similar work. Those students are prepared for a high level of education or in the managers or leaders positions within an organization. For example, the financial sector or they even work in the field of education.  If I look at both sides, I have to admit my disagreement with the implementation of volunteer work in schools. Students should not be forced to earn money for their education. In my view, the responsibility to educate each generation of students is on the government. What I am trying to say is that parents of children would not pay for their education. If we want to have a growing economy in the future, we have to invest and participate more in developing our pillar of education.  If I had a chance to make a change, I would have given more money from the government budget to the education sector.

I would take the chance to go back in time, rewind my 'life tape' and restart from the beginning to live each and every single moment as it were the last.

Others think that students benefit more from new teachers each year.     I think both options are good, when the students have the same teacher for several years, they will understand the model of the teaching that the teacher has and will adapt themselves to focus more os classes than on things like the uncertainty about which teacher they will have in the next class.    Nonetheless, have different teachers is good too, when the students have new teachers every year, they might be more sociable compared to other students, they adapt themselves to other realities, have other opinions and ppints of views, and are more adapted to real live situations when they will meet new people every day.    How I argue, the fist or the second option have benefits and issues, the better option is to choose a hibrid model, mixing both options to improve the students knowledge and adapt them to different situations. We can only choose a teacher for the student's first five years and after making them choose a different teacher each year, in this model we can have the benefit of both options and reduce the bias we could have adopted only one option.

However, some parents feel that video games can have a negative impact on their children, but others believe that they may have some positive effects.     Like other things in life, playing video games has no positive or negative impact if used in moderation, let's share some examples: If you drink too much it will have a negative impact on your life, if you don't drink it will have a negative impact as well because you don't will have social interaction. On the one hand, if you watch the news every day, you will go crazy, on the other hand if you don't see any news, you will be uninformed.    As you can see, when we talk about extreme behaviors, we are talking about problems and negative impacts in our life. The key is not playing video games and having positive or negative impact, the key is to balance usage to only have benefits without problems.     Some parents argue that video games increase children's violent acts, but it has not been proven, some children have psychological problems that do not originate in video games, these children need to be treated as isolated cases and not as normal cases applied to everyone.     Video games have been proven to improve brain activity and prevent some illnesses such as Ausimer and other neurological problems in old age. Video games are an entertainment tool and need be used as such.

The only disadvantage to studying in another country is the distance from home that makes the student feel separated from their family, and they have probably already missed many local events.

{"input": "Many people believe that it is important to always tell the truth. In your opinion, is it ever acceptable to tell a lie?<U+00A0> Explain your answer giving reasons and specific examples.\n\nTelling the truth is one of the ways of communication among people. However, some aspects have a major impact on our outcome. To give an illustration, the expression of the truth or a lie depends on if we are talking to an old person, the listener's mood, or even if we are subordinate to the listener we speak to at the moment. What is acceptable more to tell the truth or a lie? Firstly, before making a decision, to tell the truth, or a lie depends on how well we know the person who is listening to us. A good illustration of telling the truth is supported by our knowledge of the personality of the person we want to speak to. To be more precise, positive attitude and be in a balance with the person we decided to tell the truth. Conversely, we intentionally try to avoid telling lies. Instead, we are saying things differently or presenting them in a way that is not clear. As a result, it gives us a chance to put some arguments. The situation could turn against us if we intentionally lie on the first try. Telling the truth, or a lie depends on the situation and the receiver of our speech. We lie intentionally to avoid difficulties when we knew that our arguments would not be supported by an idea. In my view, it seems reasonable to consider the way we present that something is wrong. When I am in the position to choose the truth or a lie, I always try to see things from different angles, not to turn a blind eye to one side of it.

It is the most persuasive way to have positive communication and reach a result, which brings benefits on both sides.

Existing without the rhythm, sounds and beats of the music we love, cannot be defined as life. Living life to the fullest means transposing our emotions and feelings in notes, making them eternal. Music encapsulates most of our precious memories and unforgettable moments. Nothing compares to it.  Music gives colour to our lives and it has therapeutic effects, calming and making us feel amused, fulfilled and reassured. It can be a safety valve, a safe anchor when you feel lonely and depressed.

Music Helps Establish a Connection with Self  Connecting with one\u2019s inner self is an essential factor in leading a positive and wholesome life. The best way to go deep down and connect with oneself is through meditation. While many people try to meditate only a few are able to do it successfully. Most people find it hard to sit in silence and dive deep inside and thoughts usually make concentration impossible. Music can make this process easier.  Music can calm the mind and help us to focus.

Do you agree? Write your **argumentative essay**.\n\nSupporting young people to live an active life is much harder than it was 10 years ago or in my childhood. Many people suffer from not having an active lifestyle severe health problems like obesity. A good example is that children spend more time on social networks and by playing games on their mobile phones. Do our children need medication for their addiction to technology? I am in two minds about it. On one hand, in most cases, the technology is not on the blame. In early childhood, children are equipped with new technology. What is more, the natural environment in which young children grow and learn is intentionally replaced by the new technology. This artificial environment supports different stimuli of the brain. For instance, they do not think that doing sports activities is what they need. The simple reason for that is to get from their comfort zone. Getting out of their comfort zone represents effort and there is no persuasive argument to do it. Some individuals can see doing a sport as a way of relaxation of the body or the brain. Others just want to break their previous records. Sports activities provide satisfaction. Conversely, someone can feel it frustrating. On the other hand, technology can have a positive effect on our brains. As evidence of that is using technology as a tool of education.  In my view, doing sport is an important part of our life. It makes us positive if we do some sport activity regularly. By and large, it keeps us in a good shape. For example, when we get older, we do not rely on others to give us a helping hand.  As far as I am concerned, if I were in the position to change the lifestyle of the children from their childhood, I would have made it mandatory to do some sport based on your choice at least 3 times a week. No matter, how old the children are. It is our moral responsibility, to do something positive for the health of our children. Last but not least, it is not so late to act tomorrow.

However I'd like to dig deeper into this topic since I find music crucial for my life moreover I can't remember a day in which music hadn't been a part of.  Ancient people used to make sounds which turned into melodies and created first music without even realizing it. There must have been a reason for coming up with a completely new thing such as music. Since then music has taken part in rituals, as celebration but even in comforting someone feeling blue.  Needless to say never have I met a person who would have told me they didn't listen to any music. There is no need for a specific genre, every single person listens to something. They might even have access to the internet yet they involve music by simply singing some melodies in their daily lives.  In conclusion yes I do believe music is necessary for our lives from making us feel understood in those lyrics of songs to motivating us during doing chores.", "target": 6.0, "cefr": "B2", "essay_id": "essay_d5c3ed92b27f81d0", "split": "dev", "n_edits": 18.0}

I lived with my parents until I was eighteen years old and after that I ingressed university in another city and that is why I needed to live alone. I learned a lot from this situation, because you need to respect other people's space and they need to respect your space, other things like taking care of your money, feeding you, cleaning the house and studying alone and good to prepare you for the future , when you won't have your parents to look after you. I believe that people who don't experience these things will suffer more in the future with routine problems like work, wife or husband than people who lived alone during college phase. When you don't have your parents around, it's a great time to grow up and take charge of your life. Of course there are exceptions, I know some colleagues who studied with me and did not live with their parents and still grew up like me, but most colleagues who studied far from their parents grow up fast and after they finished the course at university they preferred to continue living on their own own. In my opinion, when you leave your parents' house and live alone, it's very difficult to go back and accept the rules that your parents want in their house, you want your space and your freedom and that's why you don't accept to return.", "target": 6.5, "cefr": "B2+", "essay_id": "essay_56dbe580943ff2ed", "split": "dev", "n_edits": 8.0}

How can it be solved?\n\nTo start a discussion about the problem of doctors not going to rural areas, we first need to talk about a common behavior shared by all humans beings.  Is a main knowledge that our parents teach us since our childhood to be the best person as possible in our lives, it's not unusual for everyone learn things such as the importance of the money to have a good or a comfortable life, we learn to valorize our time to achieve the better position as possible. So, when talk about the medical doctos who choose a comfortable life in the city, where they can earn more money, it easy to understand why they choose this option. if I were in the same position I will choose the same option.  When we think about our life-time, we remember that our life is limited, we have a certain quantity of time to spend, and we need to spend this time in the more intelligent way as possible. There are more people living in cities than in rural areas, people who live in cities are more richer than people who live in rural ares, for this reason is not rational choose live in another place. In my opinion, the reasons which made doctors choose live in cities than in rural areas is only rational. It's not normal to choose a worse option if you have a better one. But, it is not a rule, there are some medical doctors who choose live in rural ares, these professionals don't need a lot of money. they just want to help poor people or they want to have a peaceful live living in a place just for lifestyle.

Which type of arrangement do you think is most effective? Explain, giving reasons to support your answer.\n\nWhen we talk about offices, we nearly always think of a large room located in a new office building in the center of a city, but this way of thinking is just a stereotype, in many cases the offices are located in places that cannot have the correct infraestructure that the company needs to operateo or they just want this location as a strategic option. \t We cannot determine a single layout for all offices because companies have different realities, some companies need an open plan office for their employees, other companies want different and separate spaces to have more control over interactions for security reasons or for commecial reasons.   \t In my opinion, the reality of work is dramatically changing after Covid-19, many people around the world have found a new way of working, they have been starting work from home and enjoyed it, I don't think offices will ever be the same as before as of 2020, people today feel more comfortable working from home, and this workforce behavior is a challenge to traditional business models that force their employees to return to the office. Many people won't go back to their old model.  \t We have two main differences in the office work model, the first is a model that involves knowledge, for this type of professional, sharing information and experience is more important than working hard alone, the other type of workforce is that people who work on bureaucractic tasks that don't change or that don't require creativity, this type of person can work alone for many hours and have no problem with it.

Give details to support your opinion.\n\nSome high schools require students to complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate. In my opinion this is a good way to improve students skills, with this hands-on volunteering experience they will learn about the importance of charity and be more socialized professionals compared to students who do not have the same experience.  When students participate in charitable actions, they learn how important it is to society as a whole, a person who has enough time, energy and money to volunteer in any activity, will be more respected and recognized than others who have the same opportunity and don't use it to improve.  When high schools require students volunteer for some local work, they are not just trying to improve the quality of life for the poor, they are trying spread good deeds and create empathize with students.  A person who grows knowing how other people need their help will work better in team member than students who are more antisocial, volunteering is good for everyone, students have a lot of free time and could use that time to do something important.  When an employer sees volunteer work on a resum\u00e9, he immediately recognizes the importance of that person who is trying to get a job with him, I have no doubt that that task is important for the lives of the next generations, they will grow up with fundamental values that will change our society to a better way than we have improved at this time.

Do you think all students should have to study music? Support your opinion with reasons and examples.\n\nA common topic when we talk about schools requirements is music class, this is controversial and divides opinions between parents and students. Despite the nobli goal involved in this requirement, some people are not able to play any musical instrument or don't feel comfortable to attend a class where they are obliged to learn how to play a musical instrument.  There are schools where students must attend music classes, in other they may not be required, and in some schools may be no music classes at all, in my opinion, schools should offer the possibility to attend a music class, but it should be optional and not a requirement.   I will use my example to explain my own point of view, today I'm  thirdy years old and don't play any musical instrument. This is not a ploblem to me because I used my time to learn things that is useful to me, for me know how to play a musical instrument is not an important thing and I'm happy with this decision. If I had been forced to attend a music class when I was at school I certainly would have hated it.  Although this arguments, I think music class is an important thing to students who want to learn how to play some instrument.

Which do you think is a better choice? Give reasons to explain your answer.\n\nWhen we are undergraduates, we are just at the beginning of our life, we don't know many things and we are experiencing new realities, feelings and living new moments that build our personality over time. Some students move and live alone wile others choose to live at home with their family, let's talk about these two options.  Both options have vantagens and disadvantages, the first option improve more experiences to students than the second one, when students decide to live in a campus or rent an apartment close to the university, they will learn how the adult live is, they will understand a reality that was different that they have in their parents' house, they will learn things that only the life impose to them. Live alone is a challenge for everyone, but is a great moment when they can grow faster.  The second option is more comfortable, when a student keep living at parents' house during college time, they will save more money compared to move away to live in their own. In contrast, many opportunities and experiences will be lost comparatively. Another advantage of living with parents is the fact that they have more free time to focus on the subjects they need learn.  Both options are good, sometimes a student doesn't have the option to choose, a student must live with his parents because he hasn't enough money to live by herself for example, sometimes, the parents' house is very far from the university that student must move away to live closer and spent less time and money.  Despite the options, the most important thing for students is not this short time they will live with parents or not, what matters is learn new things and be happy with what they have at the moment.

If you are involved in noise and have a lot of intense days, you'll never think about important things, you need some time to reflect on important matters, get to know yourself more deeply and relax, take it easy, life is not something you can use intensively, you need to balance your rountine to achieve a healthier way of life.

It's normal to tell lies to other people, what we need to avoid is telling lies that will harm others, this needs to be avoided.  We have two different types of lies, the small, safete lie and the big, harmful lie. The first is used when we need help someone to be happier, for example, when you wife asks you if she was fat, you are going to lie obviously, this lie is not a problem for society, it is used to make your wife happier and have no harmful consequences. Problems occur when you use a big harmful lie, sometimes we use this mechanism to gain benefits for ourselves and in many cases this lie will harm other people, it is a painless gain.  In my opinion, liying is a natural and implicit act of humans being, we need to use it with caution and think about the possible results of our lie will have in the bahavior of others, if a lie is discovered people will no longer trust us. Keep a lie hidden is difficult, in some point the lie will be discovered and we need be prepared to face the consequences.

{"input": "In some offices, employees work in enclosed workstations or cubicles. Other offices have a more open design, in which there are no walls separating employees from their coworkers. Which type of arrangement do you think is most effective? Explain, giving reasons to support your answer.\n\nNowadays, we spend most of our life is spent working at the office. Therefore, it might be utterly useful to analyze which model of office it is better to achieve the huge goals enterprises face in this tough times. In the following lines I will discuss this issue.   On the one hand, it is pretty common to watch people working in enclosed cublicles .Rarely do we find work place where employees can work in large and pleasant offices like Google ones. Despite the evidence that this open design offices empower the productivity of  enterprises, it seems to me so hard to find something like this in our cities.  On the other hand, it is widely known that workers can perform better if their employer give them such a comfortable space to work where they are able to see what is going on in the office. As far as I am concerned, feeling being part of the company, workers will give their best to carry on with the daily affair of enterprise.   In brief, unless we absolutely change the way we work and where we work it will be hardly difficult to improve the workers life. Hence, it is imperative to reconsider the design of our offices. In this case, I totally believe that open design offices are a good deal better than classical ones.   To sum up, I vividly believe that it is time to keep our offices up to date and redesign our work places in order to make them more practical and useful to twenty first thentury needs.

{"input": "Many people believe that it is important to always tell the truth. In your opinion, is it ever acceptable to tell a lie?<U+00A0> Explain your answer giving reasons and specific examples.\n\nAiming at high moral values has long been regarded as a hallmark of a modern, sensible human being. That feature alone accounts for our perception of moral superiority. Thus, it is not nonsensical to deduce that deprived of spirituality, moral challenges, and reliability, human beings find themselves threatened in their core values. Does really life revolve all about meeting basis needs? Absolutely not. On the face of it it seems that truthfulness is a baseline for all successful human interactions, yet, after close examination an entirely ifferent picture emerges. What if benefits of fibbing or even downright deception overhaul perks of truthfulness? Let's take a closer look at a handful of instances in which this is the case ranging from heartbreaking home truths, terminal illness, brutal truth of life to an item of apparently neutral information potentially capable of wrecking havoc and destabilise human lives. Yes, in order for a person to thrive it is permissible to sift, omit, or bent the hash truth. It falls within the guidelines for affection to a friend claim. A different approach entails going around the houses and attempting to avoid the burning issues. Instead of a full-fledged condemnation, a softer approach is advisable in order for the interlocutor not to feel threatened. Once in a while simply omitting a fact might potentially give rise to enhanced communication between the parts. But is it worth it? There is no a black and white answer to this  question.

Therefore, banning them can be not only a catastrophic decision but an inconstitucional one.   In brief, we need to change ourselves in order to mend this huge issue.

On the one hand, telling the truth, you will never be worried about what you have said. Therefore, it is highly possible you would be more confident, if you had not told any lies in your life.

This tool is useful because you can see recommendations in real time, show you a grid with IELTS scale and the position of your text between levels A1 to C2. It shows the words that are wrong  and the tasks have different levels, you can start at Beginner level, advance to intermediate and advanced level. There are tasks to improve your business writing and new tasks are added monthly.

I ask because there is no possibility what people will not use their mobile phones in these places. What was the person proposing this thinking?    Today we use our smartphone to do many things, some people pay for public transport with an app, use virtual reality to try on clothes and use their cameras to access restaurant menus through QR codes displayed on the tables. there are no laws that will restrict the use of smartphones anywhere, there is only one place where people don't use their smartphones, I'm talking about high secure areas where these devices are restricted by law.      If the intent of this plan is to reduce mobile phones use to improve people's quality of life, banning it is not the right answer. We need teach people about the health problems that using their smarphones for loung hours cause on their health, we can establish rules of social behavior for some places, not to force people do what we want, but to achieve our goals by doing with people choosing themselves correct behavior in those places.      We just have to make suggestions to create the right culture, people's habits will change naturally to suit the local culture.
