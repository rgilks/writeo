I think that this amendment could have a bad impact on youger part of our society as well as on the other part of residences of our city. Nowadays phones are very crucial in our lives, therefore banning the use of them can discourage people from using public transport, moreover shopping market can go into reccesion, because people would be more willing to buy things via the Internet, without supporting local bussinesses which can lead to their bankruptcy. On the other hand, I support banning use of mobile phones in restaurants. I find that possibility  to talk to each other without using mobile phones might increase integration of the people between them.

Similarly, I believe that wild animals should live freely, in the wild, in their environment. Zoos are not a good place for wild animals in my opinion, especially traditional and ancient zoos  where animals stay imprisoned in a small cage, suffering high levels of anxiety and misbehavior from visitors, modern parks are a very different option where animals have large spaces just for them while visitors can see them from a distance without disturbing them, but I really think the best thing for animals is to live in absolute freedom in the places where they were born in their natural environment surrounded from other wild animals as they lived long ago. Other very important thing is to take care of them, and I agree that it is easier in a zoo with vets close to them, but this is also possible to do it in a bigger space, perhaps with a big effort but possible due to the existence of poachers that represent a real danger and from whom it is necessary to protect the animals.", "target": 8.0, "cefr": "C1", "essay_id": "essay_b1608fa600f6b5f7", "split": "test", "n_edits": 13.0}

Regarding the question I have some advantages and disadvanatges to mention in this paragraph . About the first point I consider advantages to learn a new language and culture, these new elements help you to adapt to the new context where you are in and make you able to deal with your academic life . Secondly , being abroad gives you a new perspective of life and you feel renovated in your thoughts and finally you  can have more chances to improve personally, maybe  you can have more possibilities to get a job and keep on studying a postgraduate course . For disadvantages, I can tell the difficulties to adapt to the new way of life and this is common and natural but many ttimes this can become hard  to overcome for the students and another point is to  live alone for a long time , most exchange students live in small rooms and they have limitations to interact with other studnets.

Regarding the first point , discipline is reinforced when people not onlye  play some instruments but also when they practise any sports because required steady practices and dedication to get succeed and to be considered the  best musician or sporty.  The second point is related to team work , even though one person can start working alone with an instrument, playing a sport or even cooking , you end becoming a group which requieres the performance of each element to achieve a unique goal as a team .  The last  point but not least important, is about  feeling confidence in what you do and some courses bring and promote these values and theses  courses are  music , sport or crafts.

However, some parents feel that video games can have a negative impact on their children, but others believe that they may have some positive effects. How do you feel about children playing video games? Give specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.\n\nVideo games are one of the most important industry since the end of the 20th century. From the mere leisure at home controlled by parents, it evolved to a real way of life difficult to keep under control with the developing of the Internet and the numbers of screens or other devices in our age .  Moreover, the marketing strategies of the video game companies aim to attract and keep people's attention. Currently, we see attention war between all theses companies. In spite of the evolution, some parents can see a  benefit by using it as way of education. Taking a look at the video game history, we can measure its positive and negative impacts.  At the beginning, the video allowed children to have fun during their free time. In fact, each child had his game device at home and could play alone or with friends. In this period, mobile phones, internet and network didn't exist. Children had to go to a specialized shop with their parents to buy each video games. Download didn't exist. Also, the small number of screens present at home allows parents to keep this activity  under control. They were able to answer to the following questions : \u30fbWho my child is playing with? \u30fbHow long my child is playing? \u30fbWhat sort of game my child is playing with? So, at the beginning, video game appeared as a good way to make new friends.   The developing of Internet changed the rules at the end of the 90's. Indeed, children have now the possibilty to when, where and how they want. Parents have now a lot of difficulties to keep an eye on their children practiced due to the increasing of devices. From a way to make real new friends, nework allows us to play with virtual unkonwon friends coming from all the world. Currently, it is almost impossible for the parents to answer to the 3 questions see above.  However, some parents take advantage of this situation. Internet offers  new ways to improve skills and ability. Children can learn speaking language or playing an instrument thanks to the Internet and educative video games.  To conclude, video games can benefit to children if their parents control the practice and offer other activities to maintain good health, physics and mental.

Where the health system is mainly public, salary would not be different between cities and country side or rural areas. Where the health system is principally private, doctors could have very different salary depending on the hospital or health center where them work. Personally I think that doctors could not earn so different salary depending on where they usually work because the health of people could not be sobject to business or economy system. In my opinion everybody could have the right to be cured. For this reason doctors could earn equal salary or just a little bit more in some cases, for example doctors who have more experience or doctors who have notable  skills could earn a little bit more but not much more.

In your opinion, is it ever acceptable to tell a lie?<U+00A0> Explain your answer giving reasons and specific examples.\n\nIn general I believe that telling the truth will always be the right decision, but there are exceptions. In the following essay I would like to propose my thoughts on the topic 'why it is important to always tell the truth'. Every relationship, which one is irrelevant, is based on trust and lies, even if they are not harmful ones by themselves, are destroying this fundamental part, because dealing with trust issues in a relationship is not healthy for anyone and will ultimately cause the end of a friendship or a relationship between girlfriend and boyfriend. Besides being a destructive mannner in relationships with others, being untruthful is a huge burden for your own mental health as well. It takes a lot to prevent a lie from being coughed, for instance a lot of new believable lies, causing a lot of pressure on the liar himself. Telling the truth might not be the most comfortable way to go at first, but it sure is over time compared to keeping a lie alive. Most of us know the relieve caused by a lie being coughed and the truth coming out, which is great but whereas you could feel it a lot earlier by telling the truth to begin with . But as I implied at the beginning, there are certain situations where it is acceptable to lie. Those are if you have to prevent something bad to happen from a third person, like keeping a secret for someone even if another person asks if you know about something.", "target": 7.0, "cefr": "B2+", "essay_id": "essay_b6db3163d5d69fee", "split": "test", "n_edits": 10.0}

I simply answer with vacations because we are provided with weekends which are holidays for us and help us to refresh ourselves and get ready for the coming days. On the other hand we have vacations which help us in changing our state of mind and get back the lost peace of mind. Last month I went to my native place for the vacations all alone. These vacations were really important me because it was my first trip to the place in many years and I wanted to see the changes that place has gone with. According to my expectations that place did change a bit but there were not much prominent changes that could have shocked me. It was overwhelming when I reached there after so many years.

{"input": "Because of the negative effects on health of an inactive lifestyle, all university students and school children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week. Do you agree? Write your **argumentative essay**.\n\nI would like to give arguments against forcing students to do sports activities three times per week. First of all I agree with critics, who are in favor of such a rule, to the point that it has negative effects on the health of students, if they are not active enough, but forcing them to do something is a bit too much in my eyes. It may cause another new problem, that students might lose the joy at doing sports, because they have no other choice. Of course, there has to be a solucion, preventing the students from suffering of health problems, but I believe there are better ways to do such things. Assuming that there would be sports activities included in the schoolday, it will lead to more classes, causing the students to stay in school longer and in the end to study later at the evening and lack of sleep does also have negative effects on health. My proposal would be to sensitize the students to the topic, instead of making decisions over their heads. Because if they would understand the importance of being active, they might adapt certain habits to their everyday life. That would be in so far more beneficial than forcing them to do something, that they could decide which kind of sports activity they prefer and when they have the time to do them. That would also teach them to be more independent and to take responsibility for their own life and health, because after school nobody will take interest in how active they are. Of course there had to be a seminar on how to achieve a more active lifestyle, but that would only take up one or two afternoons. Besides that every school and university may consider to establish an office to help the students with that quest and keeps track on how they are doing. In conclusion, something has to be done, but using force is never the right choice.", "target": 8.5, "cefr": "C1+", "essay_id": "essay_e3ffbcdfac6a843e", "split": "test", "n_edits": 16.0}
{"input": "Some people believe zoos are good places for people to learn about animals. Other people believe animals belong in nature and it is wrong to keep them in zoos. What do you think? Explain, giving specific reasons for your choice.\n\nLately, we can observe an interesting debate about how an animal should be considered in our society. Governments begin to design, to create laws to ensure protection of animals . Many activist groups are taking action against the food industry to denounce how much animals suffer as a result of their practices. These activits are talking about animals mistrating. Over and over, animals is considered more and more as a human be. This situation highlights the question of the interest of zoos in our society. Facing some people who believe it is a good place to learn about animals, other are campaigning for a zoo ban. Finally, this debate has forced individuals to question the violence of civilization.   First of all, to my opinion, zoo can be considered as a cultural site like a museum. Indeed, it allows people to open mind, to learn something new and finally to increase their personal culture. But it seems important to have a good approach when we enter inside. We should not consume a zoo as a product. Nor should we behave like a fair. To avoid this behaviour, zoos need to put more emphasis on how they care for animals rather than using them at fairs. This would improve their image in society.  Second, the behaviour of activists can also raise certain questions. Denaturing must of course be denounced. But activists tend to move away from simple denunciation. Many citizens equate their actions with terrorism. In fact, activists can appear harmful because they reconsider, sometimes violently, our way of life. They may be uncompromising in their attitude.  You are either with them or against them. Also, one question remains unanswered in their speeches: Can we be sure that living in the wild is safer than living in a zoo for some animals?  To conclude, it seems that communication is the key of the problem. Both of the actors described, would benefit  from  improving their speeches. Indeed, highlighting the happiness of animals, their speeches appeared more perceptible and more effective.

{"input": "Some students choose to study in another country for a time during high school or university. What do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of studying abroad?\n\nSince the early 2000's, the Internet has broken all borders around the world. One lives in the age of exchange. Information,  knowledge, skills are more and more important resources. Nowadays, social medias and digital applications allow global companies to pick up the best candidates. In this context, I 'm going to present, to my opinion, the advantages and the disadvantages for studying abroad for students.  Firstly, I think that studying abroad is an opportunity. Soft skills are as important as technical skills. Travels promote the development of these soft skills. When a student chooses to study abroad, he goes out his or her zone of comfort. He or she has to adapt to  a new environment and find out solutions by himself  in many daily situations such as rent an apartment, find a job,...Also, discovering a new culture, meeting natives allows him or her to be an open-minded person. Of course, learning a new language takes an important place in this students development. The ability to adapt, to understand others perspectives, to go out of the box and to speak many languages are for sure great advantages.  The main global companies are looking for these soft skills when they receive applications.  However, this situation has led to many inequalities among students around the world. In fact, only some students will  be  able to travel or to have access to these new technologies that is to say more likely students from developed countries. The others will remain outside the current requirements of the labour market. Low-paid and unattractive jobs will be their only job opportunities. The main danger is to create a social divide between peoples and continents.  Finally, I believe that, studying abroad, offers great personal opportunities but, at the same time, produces inequalities and social risks between students, i.e. between cultures. We must be careful not to create a two-tier society.      ", "target": 6.5, "cefr": "B2", "essay_id": "essay_271df80e28327a80", "split": "test", "n_edits": 30.0}

Primarily because I think that we spend way too much time on social media or on our phone in general and if we would concentrate on having conversations again, for instance in a restaurant, our social life would benefit extremely. But besides hemming our communication, our smartphone use can also be a huge safety threat in public. On the on hand for our privacy, because with them anyone is able to take pictures or videos of strangers and put them on the internet or share them with his or her friends, even without that persons approval. On the other hand is it dangerous for your physical health in various ways. Of course is constantly checking our phone neither good for your eyes nor for your brain, but such a prohibitation could barely help with those concerns. Although what it may help with are reducing the many accidents caused because someone is distracted by his or her phone. For example those incidents where someone is not paying attention while walking over the street or stepping into a train and falls, would be prevented. Personally I do not really see the necessarity for such a ban in shops, because it helps with neither of the other concerns, but that is just my view on the topic. In general I am supportive of that idea and hope it will be introduced apperantly.

Support your opinion with reasons and examples.\n\nMany years ago the role of the music in learning changed completely, before that music was absolutely forgotten in curriculums and programs, being restricted to Schools of Music. In the earlies 90, music was included like a subject for all students in Secondary Schools, and a controversial situation was produced, because this measure was received in a very different way in each centre, while in some of them the new was happily accepted, in others was hardly critised, depending on the importance that music was considered in theirs, so it was possible to find diverse options from some where the music was not only compulsory but it was recommended that students learnt to play some musical instrument to other ones where the music was treated like a minor option.

But for over some time, it is being observed that the system is failing to provide that security to the Doctors and as an outcome of it is a major outflow of highly qualified doctors to the other countries.  We need to locate the main reasons behind the outflow of Doctors and simultaneously, we need to resolve this problem. Most of the Doctors move out of the country to find better working opportunities that can bring their knowledge into application and they are valued and respected for that. It will be unfair to say that there are no opportunities in our country but they are very sparsely available.  Many people go to other countries to earn good money and the same happens with the Doctors as well. They opt for going out to earn money and a lot of it. If we compare the ratio of their earnings in and out of the country then we will find that they earn huge money in other countries.  Some doctors don't go to other countries to earn money, but they find research work more attractive in those countries in comparison to home country. This can be taken care of if the governmnet put money in research projects locally and build a good research environment.

We have moved from paper, pen, physical punishment by teachers at the beginning of the 20th century, to the use of electronic devices and greater attention to student confidence. In this context, a question arises : What will the school of the future be ? In the following paragraphes, we will think about in what ways schools might be the same and different in the future.  First of all, the advent of the Internet has brought about profound changes in teachers' work and students' attitudes. In fact, teachers have had to use new technology as a new way to pass on knowedge more efficiency.  Without the Internet, the school would seem totally disconnected from the real world and would lose all credibility. Moreover, using the Internet in class is certainly the only way to teach. Millenials grew with the Internet.  In this context, it is well known that children have a low attention span.. It is difficult for them to maintain their concentration on one subject over a long period of time.  Teachers need to adapt the way they teach to this situation. The use of the Internet will probably be the same in schools in the future.  But the job of the teacher may be different. In fact, home-school is more and more developed thanks to many websites. The students might not need to go to school to learn something. Virtual and distance learning could be the next way to learn. Students will choose between  teachers all over the world according to their expectations.

Do you agree? Write your **argumentative essay**.\n\nForcing university students and school children to do sports is not a violation of their freedom to choose the life they wish. The lifestyle our young people conduct freaks me out and taking action is a must for their own good. Doing sports does not boil down to whether they want to do or not, it is a prerequisite to establish a healthy society. Three ideas are to discuss in this piece of paper. Doing sports must be obligatory in any curriculum, the benefits of doing sports are undeniable, and students must not be left for their own devices.  To begin with, any successful curriculum must include sports. Sports at our universities and schools are not just for embellishment but an integrated component in education. However, forcing students to do sports does not imply to force them violently. Some tricks to adopt, for instance, can be in a form of initiatives like giving our students the freedom to choose the type of sport they fancy. Also important is the idea of competition. Students can be lured by rewarding competitions.   As to the benefits of doing sports, they are too many to count in this piece of paper. First, doing sports are a good shield against addiction to alcohol or smoking opium. Second, doing sports results in having a healthy society. A healthy society is an active and productive one. Third, research shows that students who do sports regularly have a positive view about life and high spirit. This is of vital importance for their school performance.  Nevertheless, forcing university students and school students to do sport is not the end; it is the beginning. Universities and schools should accommodate students with decent and healthy food, clean cloakroom gym and so on and so forth. Knowing the financial background of our students is a must too.   In fine, forcing students to do sport is for their own good after all. Students' current lifestyle is detrimental and poisonous and forcing them to do sports implicitly is our duty.

Paradoxically, many genius people and especially students are from Romania because of their willing and native cognitive abilities rather than the school.  In some other countries, the volunteering is part of the school itself and this is an advantage. You can go to workshops and extend your range of knowledge with history, informatics, design etc.; you can help needy like elderly or poor children from disadvantaged area and you can also get involved in your community.  The final aspect of volunteer work is the demantatoryness, which is quite controversing due to the fact that few students with special talents may have been forbidden to do some other things by teachers as to do volunteer work. For instance, a very clever guy from Germany was forbidden by his teacher to go to Olympics on the reason he has to do volunteer work and Olympics are held anNually. With this discrimination I can't agree.  What I like about volunteer work is that you get to know new people - rich or poor, gipsy or Jewish . A public activity or a community like going to school must have a wide variety of options for you to offer as to be eassier to discover what you truly love to do, but it mustn't be demantadory or forbidden anything.

Which do you think is a better choice? Give reasons to explain your answer.\n\nMoving away during the student life is a common thing.. In the second case is recommended to live at home and this way you don't have to look in on friends, relatives or other acquaintances.  If you have to move away you must think up for a source for income if you don't have one already and also search for a place to stay for rent or even to buy and last but not least there is the third option: staying at the fireplace. To be honest there is a really friendly atmosphere in there but the government universities from Romania are totally miserable with little exceptions- the most prestigious universities which are known in the entire Europe.  If you're already set up in the mertopolis you're going to study is a huge environmental advantage because the other people are like emigrants while you're in your own habitat and you don't need to pay the fee for the fireplace or the rent.  If talking about university life it's a more important question whether to go to university or not rather than staying home or moving away. Sir Ken Robinson said there is an academic inflation which means teenagers take up studying eithter dead subjects or overlearned. For instance do you take courses to take up the trash? NO! I don't say all higher education is useless, but some universities and more specific, some faculties, teach something that is not cost-effective as time, intelligence, money and effort and you are trapped by what you've been taught in society and believe it will help you.

That is because of a few different reasons. First of all life does not only consist of the adventures you experience, it is also about your friends and family. A short life would not allow you to spend as much time with them as a long one does. In the end your fast and intense lifestyle may cause emotional pain to your loved ones. Secondly I am not that adventurous as a person as well. I like to chill with my friends and relax on my own, but a real adventure scares me more than it brings me a rush and joy, which makes the option of a longer and calmer life sound far more appealing to me. Of course I do see positive aspects of a more intense lifestyle as well. Many people ask  themselves what they achieved at the end of their lives, because at last only the most exciting parts stick in your memory. A person who did plenty of those intense things may feel more fulfilled than a person who always chose the safe path in life.

Grammar errors and misuse of terms are indicated, and learners can learn the correct expressions. To learn English, you can think of going to school or reading textbooks by yourself. However, English conversation classes are expensive, and in the case of self-study, it is not easy to maintain motivation. W&I is free of charge. There is also a function that makes you want to continue learning. When you submit English sentences, the score is shown. Students want to get a high score, so you will study English hard to get a high score, and if you get a high score, you will study further to get a higher score. W&I can also learn anytime, anywhere if you have access to the Internet. W&I is created and run by Cambridge, a sophisticated education system.

Nowadays, a comprehensive knowledge of English is of paramount importance for those who aim to carve out a successful career abroad. As far as I am concerned, mastering English well enough to work in an English-speaking country is one of my most cherished dreams. There are plenty of reasons that prompted me to accumulate an extensive knowledge in this language. First of all, I would like to draw attention to the beneficial effects that an excellent grasp of English is bound to have on my career path. As a professional journalist, I have been nurturing the lifelong ambition of working at The Washington Post since I was a child. Now that I am a grown-up woman, I am determined to make this dream come true. A proven ability in writing and speaking English with an amazing degree of accuracy is likely to allow me to get a foot in the door in this world-renowned newsroom whose journalistic tradition is a pillar of democracy.  Next, I hold firmly to the belief that an advanced level of English is an immense asset when it comes to building relationships. As a lingua franca, English is understood everywhere, thus making it easier for people to communicate. By socialising with people coming from all over the world, it will be easier for me to strike up new friendships, rub shoulders with the movers and shakers in the media industry, as well as explore new cultures and broaden my horizons.

The optimisation of a flexibile working is a huge benefit of this concept.   In workstations that are closed, people are hindred to communicate with one another. This makes it difficult to reach another co-worker. An advantage of this concept is that every worker is able to tend his job in peace.  New enterprises profit from open space offices. If you want to let an enterprise grow and your team is getting larger, such a concept makes it easier to add desks, chairs and walls.  An open space office enhances the moral value of the work team in general. It gets rid of social roles and helps each member to become more accessible one another.

We usually study the English in four main parts. So there is listening, reading comprension, grammar and the use of English which is basically speaking. The area which I prefer is speaking and the second one is the reading. Although I do not why I like speaking and reading maybe because they are funnies if these are compared to the grammar.  I think that listening is not for me the best area but it is because I find it very difficult. Of course as I have said before listening is the area which I have to practicse more. So I will spend more time watching English movies or training to listen to some audio and using better scholastic devices as CD rom or interactive books. Finally to achieve the promotion in the current level I have just an option: study and spend more time in the areas where I have some gaps. For these reasons I am thinking about planning the study better.  It means that last year I spent studying many hour just before the exams but next year I will spend one hour each day preferring to be more constant.

The common side of this two places is both of them are just designed only for the work.

Because your desk has a limited area which only essential materials can be afforded.   Nowadays designs of the working offices are seems to be more free than we are expected to see. For example in these workplaces generally do not have dress codes. That means you can wear anything that you are comfortable with. The main idea of creating such a free working space is to inspiring the workers and thus they can create new original ideas about their work.

To understand my point of view, I think it's important to take a closer look at the words health and wealth.  First of all, we generally associate health with our physical condition and the health of our bodies. But today, especially in times of lockdown, we find that mental health is also very important. Many people suffer from not being able to work and earn money. They feel bad about not being able to see their desires, their wishes, their ambitions unfulfilled. In addition, their social status is very important. Feeling useless with an inability to climb the social ladder, they find themselves in a moving situation. Earning money is crucial for a balanced life.  Secondly, wealth cannot be reduced to the amount of money you have in your account. The ability to learn, to acquire new skills, to have friends and to understand other points of view can be considered rich. This process plays an essential role in the balanced life we seek.  In conclusion, being rich is essential for maintaining good health.   ", "target": 8.0, "cefr": "C1", "essay_id": "essay_39691f1a39cc08be", "split": "test", "n_edits": 6.0}

It is therefore essential to live our life to the fullest. People believe that a peaceful life is a way to enjoy life, while the other regards a life with more intensity is a better life even when they have to spend a shorther time living. For most people, being able to live for a century with calmness and harmony is the greatest way to live.  Living an intensive life will disable us from knowing the most essential meanings of life. It may include dangerous or even illegal events such as doing drugs or maybe living an unhealthy life. According to research, people who do drugs, enjoy racing or live unhealthy share a similarity of living shorter than those who do not.  Calm life creates numerous opportunities in life. Most successful people live a longer live as they put effort into trying a better solution to the problem but not becoming pessimistic and feeling regretful about what they did. It seems that the idea that success, being number one, managing to be better than anyone else, achieving what nobody has achieved before, realizing a dream is what we must do. Nobody tells us the price that often must be paid for this, much less that we can have other goals. Having a calm life is also an option.

I believe that banning the use of moblie phones on public transport is the best decision you could have made, being an absolutely necessary measure for the citizens' health and wellness. I consider this, because it is well-known how the radiation of the phones affects humains' health and that it is amplified in the means of transport. Judging by how many people are every day on public transport, we can equal the radiations level they are exposed to, to a situation in which people are all gathered in a microwave.         Also, the use of mobile phones should be banned from shops too. Most people go shopping, esspecially in malls, not to actually do their shopping, but to relax. The problem is that all of them have phones and are using them for surfing the Net, looking on Instagram, Facebook and anything else. So the banning of the mobile phones, at least in the big markets, like malls, is a well-founded decision.        As well, restricting the phones in restaurants is an excellent move to improve the citizens health. It would be better if the people could have dinner or lunch out and see the restaurant as a place of relaxing and socializing, not a place where all people have their eyes stuck on the screens and do not have the slightest ideea of what is happening around them.

{"input": "Some people believe zoos are good places for people to learn about animals. Other people believe animals belong in nature and it is wrong to keep them in zoos. What do you think? Explain, giving specific reasons for your choice.\n\nThere has always been a lot of heated debate surrounding the issue of zoos, and disputes over this topic have steadily increased in the last decades. Opinions are divided as to whether these places should be closing or they should continue to play a key role in today's conservation issues. While it is true that animals may suffer when deprived of their freedom, there is no doubt that zoos, if successfully managed, are considered to be valuable wildlife sanctuaries and excellent learning fields. First of all, zoos play a pivotal role in protecting endangered species and saving animals from extinction. As far as animal health is involved, there is no denying that zoos are key to the survival of wild species, which are increasingly threatened by poachers, wild predators as well as shrinking natural habitats. Another important aim for zoos is to foster research projects so as to broaden the knowledge of animal behaviour and disease, thus increasing their physical and mental wellbeing. There are teams of international scientists that are devoted specifically to carry out first-rate research which is likely to improve our understanding of the natural world we live in. The more we know about animals, the more we can push the frontiers of our knowledge in new and exciting directions for the sake of both humans and animals. Apart from learning, there is growing evidence that zoos might contribute towards raising people\u2019s awareness on environmental issues. Parks where animals are held in captivity are often the only bridge between people who live in urban settings and nature. For example, planning a trip on zoos or spending a day in a natural habitat, though artificially recreated, seems to generate a great deal of interest in environmental issues, such as the importance of biodiversity, the risk of loss habitat, the need to respect the ecological balance. With an environmental catastrophe at hand, there is every likelihood that zoos will be acting as a role model in conservation efforts in the following years. To sum up, most animal lovers seem to support the idea that zoos are detrimental to animal wellbeing. However, increasing numbers of people, myself included, take the view that allowing animals to live and bred in a secure and protected environment will bring about benefits for humanity.", "target": 8.5, "cefr": "C1+", "essay_id": "essay_d741ea0bf365093e", "split": "test", "n_edits": 8.0}

While it is true that this unpaid activity may burden students with a surplus of work, I firmly believe that social activism, personal growth and career development are opportunities that cannot be underestimated. Therefore, it is evident that students can benefit a great deal from engaging in high school compulsory volunteering. When it comes to social engagement, mandatory volunteerism plays a key role in nurturing a sense of civic responsibility and good citizenship in young people. By supporting vulnerable people who live in the neighbourhood or helping local organisations raise awareness on environmental issues, youngsters can experience the emotional fulfilment of feeling part of a community. Consequently, civic engagement will help students become aware of the world around them, foster their understanding of problems and encourage them to be part of the solutions.  Involvement in community services is closely related to personal growth. Hands-on experiences in working within poverty-stricken contexts and in dealing with people from all walks of life are likely to build youngsters\u2019 character and boost their confidence.

{"input": "Because of the negative effects on health of an inactive lifestyle, all university students and school children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week. Do you agree? Write your **argumentative essay**.\n\n       It is well-known that a healthy lifestyle is provided by sport activities done with frequency so, as far as I am concerned, the proposition that all university students and school children should be forced to practise sports activities at least 3 times per week is a good intentioned one and I one agree with.        First things first, the inactive lifestyle is a problem all humanity is facing nowadays. Because of the development of technology and the constantly increasing level of living standards, people are often choosing sedentarism to the detriment of sport or physical activities. People are moving from home to work or school and backwards by car or by means of transport instead of walking, either because of confortness or facillity, for that many cities are too wide to be able to move around walking. This is the reason why they spend almost their entire day sitting; they sit at school or at work, sit in the car or public transport, sit at home watching a movie on TV or browsing on the phone. Therefore, it will be a major success if at least the children and students will practise some sports 3 times a week.         Also, schoolers and students are the most prone categories for inactivity, because studying ocupies most of their time as so they spend more than half a day sitting on a chair. Although they can spend their breaks and their free time to relax outside and practise some physical activities like jogging or playing sports with friends, the opption they choose is not always the healthy one, most of them preferring to spend the free time chatting and surfing the Net, or simply watch some movies. If not the sport at school, this inactive lifestyle would lead to severe spine deformations, bone fragility and many other diseases.        Finally, I consider that the decision of making soprt in schools and universities mandatory is the right one, keeping in mind the inactive lifestyle everyone adopts today, in spite of an active one.", "target": 8.0, "cefr": "C1", "essay_id": "essay_1099ac94ee254dff", "split": "test", "n_edits": 14.0}

Write your article.\n\nComputers and other technological devices have become an essential tool in all areas of education. While I agree that this is true, I also believe that teachers will continue to play a crucial role in the classroom of the future. On the one hand, I agree with those who claim that blended learning is fundamental to the education sector. First, computer-based lessons are considered to be more engaging than the ones taught by teachers. Next, interactive websites and online videos are more likely to interest students, thus improving their knowledge retention and performances during exams. Finally, computers are a potentially unlimited source of information for learners. A good example could be the following: In the past, students could not help but rely on books and printed maps when asked to do research related to geography. Nowadays, software packages like Google Earth enable students to virtually visit any city of the world, even the most remote villages, thus boosting the learning process.  On the other hand, I believe that educators will not be replaced by artificial intelligence, no matter how sophisticated technology becomes. There are two reasons why I think teachers will always be at the centre of the learning experience. First, not only good educators impart knowledge, but they also nurture the passion for learning and help children develop critical thinking.  Empathy is another reason for supporting the pivotal role of teachers in the classroom. Educators can understand the emotional state of their students by reading their face, body language and appearance. Consequently, whenever they spot a weird behaviour or they become aware of some difficulties, they can connect with pupils by having meaningful conversations with them. Apart from providing children with invaluable emotional support, teachers can also maintain a close relationship with their parents. In conclusion, I agree that technology is helpful in the classroom. However, I believe that teachers will continue to thrive because of their inspirational role in youngsters\u2019 lives.", "target": 8.5, "cefr": "C1+", "essay_id": "essay_502f034e67cf9ada", "split": "test", "n_edits": 6.0}

{"input": "Read and answer the question below. Write at least 2 paragraphs. Some people sleep in a dark and quiet room. Other people sleep with a small light on and don't mind noise. How do you like to sleep? Explain your answer.\n\nThere has always been a heated debate surrounding the issue of sleeping habits. Opinions are divided as to whether we should sleep in total darkness and stony silence or we should get used to some degree of light and noise. Enthusiasts of refreshing and plentiful naps tend to extoll the benefits of dark and silent bedrooms because they think they are essential to lull us to sleep. However, more and more people are admitting that they can sleep through anything, including claps of thunder, or even their partner\u2019s severe snoring. As I have always been a deep sleeper, I do not mind dozing off in a bedroom where there is little light or noise. However, either dazzling beams of light or piercing noises are likely to keep me awake throughout the night. There is no doubt that falling asleep in dark and silent bedrooms can make all the difference when it comes to sleep quality. There is growing scientific evidence to support the fact that rooms deprived of noise and darkness can have beneficial effects on people's physical and mental wellbeing. For instance, when we turn off the lights just before going to bed, our body starts to release melatonin, the sleep-inducing hormone. The higher levels of melatonin are released in the blood, the higher are the chances for people to fall asleep. Therefore, having too bright an environment when it is time to sleep can disrupt the natural circadian rhythms, thus making people more alert and prevent them from enjoying a refreshing sleep.  When it comes to my sleeping patters, I certainly prefer falling asleep in a free-noised and dark environment. However, as I have have never suffered from sleep deprivation, I do not mind dozing off even in case there is moderate light in the bedroom.", "target": 8.0, "cefr": "C1", "essay_id": "essay_af024fe6e6bf3f70", "split": "test", "n_edits": 8.0}

Firstly, my thoughts on this subject are encouraging the idea of reducing the use of the mobile phones as nowadays we are struggling with the online life. We tend to forget how to socialize, how to disconnect and more important how to force or how to educate ourselves to balance  this two worlds, the online one and the offline one. It goes without a doubt that by banning the use of phones will help people understand the importance of the situation and how bad things could be in the near future if we do not take measures. Moreover, having a date or a casual meeting with your family or friends involves being connected and trying to bound with the beloved ones, because we do not have the time or opportunity to go every day for dinner. So I highly suggest that restaurants should apply this idea with no phones when you are serving a meal, but I can say there are a lot of opponent who will stand up for the situation when you are called maybe for an emergency. Problems like this must be taken into consideration and solutions have to be taken in the best way, as possible.

{"input": "Some students choose to study in another country for a time during high school or university. What do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of studying abroad?\n\nStudying abroad is a choice that attracts thousands of students every year. While it is true that this experience has many advantages, it also has its drawbacks. The beneficial effects of studying in another country are undeniable. As a start, being exposed to a foreign language is of enormous importance in the language acquisition process. Therefore, students who are eager to learn a second or a third language are likely to make the most of their experiences abroad. For instance, engaging in conversation with people every day may help young adults learn the language faster, retain it better and speak with a near-native pronunciation. In addition to language acquisition, spending time away from home may encourage students to familiarise themselves with different cultures, thus improving their cultural understanding. For instance, getting to grips with new rules and social norms or engaging with a new culture can turn out to be invaluable tools to see the world through different lenses. What is more, whichever language students are going to learn, studying abroad will provide them with the opportunity to meet and interact with people from all walks of life. However, studying abroad is not always associated with positive effects. First, living away from home for a certain amount of time can be ridiculously expensive. Several students simply cannot afford to pay the rent or university fees in the first place. For those who organise the trip on a shoestring, there\u2019s every likelihood that they will come back home frustrated by all the hurdles they had to overcome along the path. Next, living in a place where the nearest and dearest are far away can be extremely difficult. The odds are students will feel homesick, with major consequences on their mental wellbeing. Cultural shock is another aspect to take into consideration when it comes to the downsides of studying in a host country. Different countries mean different cultures and social norms. Adapting to a new culture may cause some physical symptoms such as insomnia, headache and loss of appetite, which are bound to contribute to making the experience disappointing. There is no denying that studying abroad can be an immense asset for students, especially in the language learning process. However, this experience can put students off easily due to the high costs, the fear of loneliness and the culture shock.", "target": 8.5, "cefr": "C1+", "essay_id": "essay_8f089f1529aebf5d", "split": "test", "n_edits": 8.0}
{"input": "Video games are very popular with children. However, some parents feel that video games can have a negative impact on their children, but others believe that they may have some positive effects. How do you feel about children playing video games? Give specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.\n\nVideo games have never been so popular among youngsters. To a certain extent, I agree that this pastime is likely to trigger health problems in teenagers as well as putting their relationships at risk. However, I also believe that a moderate use of these devices can help them enhance their cognitive development and build problem-solving skills. There is growing evidence that playing video games for an inordinate amount of time may be harmful for teenagers\u2019 health and may deplete their ability to bond with their peers. First, spending hours glued to the TV or computer screen may encourage them to live a sedentary life, thus increasing the risk of developing weight-related diseases such as diabetes or heart problems in the long run. Next, health diseases may be compounded by the onset of dysfunctional behaviour or poor mental wellbeing, which are considered the inevitable outcome of social isolation. It is no wonder that spending a great deal of time absorbed in gaming activities can prompt teenagers to stay in rather than hang out with their peers,  However, being exposed to video games for a limited amount of time may have a lot of positive influence on young people. If used with common sense, gaming consoles can help youngsters enhance their cognitive development and build problem-solving skills that may come in handy as they grow up. For example, virtual challenges may encourage young people to think fast in order to deal with an unexpected threat, thus training a skill which will prove useful in real-life settings. Online games can even have beneficial effects on children's attention, vigilance and concentration. Mental flexibility is also enhanced while playing games because teenagers and young adults are likely to learn how to engage in multiple tasks simultaneously. There is no doubt that young people are increasingly addicted to video games. While devoting a great deal of time to this activity may have devastating effects on youngsters\u2019 health and social life, I also think that moderate playing is likely to benefit their cognitive development.

My favorite teacher was Fernandez de Lara, I wanted than him to teach me all the subjects. He was a journalist too, and he taught me the subjects of book publishing and journalism workshop. He worked some years in Televisa sports, the best company in the sports business in Mexico, I want to bring up that in one class the teacher shows off his accreditations and souvenirs that he got in the Superbowls and World cup of soccer, I was excited about that because my dream is going to at Superbowl as a reporter.  On the other hand, he was always a polite and humble person with all his students, he was smiling while he gave us the class. This is not to show off but he was the most prepared and clever teacher at the university.  I remember that at Easter and bank holidays he did not stop working, he met with his students in front of the school or in the park to give his lessons. I don\u00b4t want to be repetitive ut if Mexico had more teachers how Humberto, this country will be better.  I had been working on my thesis and I wanted to get together with him and that Fernandez de Lara been my tutor, now this is impossible, today I have received horrible news, my teacher and mentor Fernandez de Lara passed away, he is no other victim of Covid, he is a loss for all Mexico.   I only want to say to him thank you very much for all your support, I get into journalism for you. Today all his students are a better person and this is for you.

But television can be a good education platform. For this to happen, there needs to be changes in people's thinking, mainly the parents who are responsible for the education of their children.

I think that just as it is normal to have animals on farms or companies like horses, cowls, sheep and pigs to help people in their daily basis generating money or at work, I think it is right to have zoo because it is also a source of income. In most zoos, animals live in a comfortable space that is very similar to their natural habitat. Animals eat quality food in the correct amount. It is possible to see that the animals are happy by the expression on their faces. On farms, animals are often not well cared for and live in a small space to put on weight. In other situations, they do not eat good food and their owners make them work hard.  Of course, not all farms are like that, bad places, there are many places where animals are treated very well and not all zoos are perfect. Therefore, it is the government's obligation to check and take attitude if the things doesn't happening the correct way. A positive point of having zoos is the fact that many children visit them every day and it is a great way to have fun and especially to learn anout animals.", "target": 6.5, "cefr": "B2", "essay_id": "essay_880f22b6478b0025", "split": "test", "n_edits": 18.0}

First, if you don't have a healthy body, you can't live long to enjoy the money you earned. If you worked too hard and destroyed your health like Steve Jobs who passed away at 50, you can't enjoy the money you 've made.

Third, you can't buy health with money. Money isn't all powerful. There are things that you can't buy with money. Such as health. Health is priceless. Thus, it's better to keep your body healthy.

{"input": "Because of the negative effects on health of an inactive lifestyle, all university students and school children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week. Do you agree? Write your **argumentative essay**.\n\nObesity in the young is one of the most pressing issues of many developed countries. To a certain extent, I agree that a sedentary lifestyle, compounded by poor dietary habits, may be detrimental to youngsters\u2019 health. However, I do not agree that school children and university students should be forced to do sports activities at least three times per week. There is no doubt that physical activity is one of the most effective ways to prevent weight-related diseases in the young. However, as children are constantly absorbed by social media platforms and glued to TV screens, they are increasingly engaged in virtual gatherings and online gaming platforms, with a dramatic reduction of the time spent in sports activities. The shift towards online playtime, which is synonymous with physical inactivity, is likely to have negative repercussions on youngsters' health. As children are becoming more and more obese, weight-related illnesses are on the rise at an alarming pace. Cardiovascular diseases and chronic health conditions, such as heart attack, stroke and type 2 diabetes, are increasingly affecting the young, thus putting a lot of pressure on national health systems of the developed nations. However, I do not believe that youngsters should be pressured into sports on a weekly basis. First, pushing children to do something beyond their will may end up to be counterproductive. Sports should be fun, not forced. And when the opposite is true, youngsters are likely to experience a further drop in motivation which can result in a complete lack of exercise. Next, forced participation can prevent children from enjoying the activity, both decreasing their desire to succeed and increasing the risk of injuries. These negative connotations may also cause children to miss out on the importance of physical wellbeing and the benefits associated with sports participation. Therefore, students should be encouraged by parents and teachers to stay physically active through activities that combine fun, entertainment and gentle exercise. Finally, pushing children into playing sports at least three times a week can have a negative impact on school achievements. In fact, children that are completely absorbed in sports have less time to focus on their homework but also less energy to devote to academic subjects. Therefore, I think that a balanced relationship between sports activities and school duties will be more beneficial to children\u2019s physical and mental wellbeing.", "target": 9.0, "cefr": "C2", "essay_id": "essay_ea553c829b75dfdf", "split": "test", "n_edits": 4.0}

This is an interesting question, obviously do some types of exercise is very important, it is not necessary to do two hours of sports activities every day, only twenty minutes will be enough. When I was a teenager I believe that it was a mistake, but some years later,   I had overweight and anxious, in fact, some school partners did me some jokes about my weight, I remember that was feeling blue for that and I wanted to throw in the towel but I decided to start to do exercise.

In my experience do exercise changed my life.   I believe that is important to combine other habits with exercise and in this form have a healthy body. A great point is to eat healthy food like chicken, meat or fish, fruits and vegetables is a key for a fit body and you should not try junk food and candies. In the same way, you can drink at least two liters of water per day. Drinking soda and alcoholic beverages are not a good idea.

Do you agree? Write your **argumentative essay**.\n\n Many people believe that it is imperative for schools and universities to make sports activities mandatory due to the life-threatening consequences of an unhealthy lifestyle. However, I have to disagree with this statement, as I believe personal health should be exclusively in the hands of the beholder. First, students and pupils ought to be in charge of their own lifestyles. Should the educational institutions impose regular sports activities, the children may not agree with them. What is more, even a sense of hatred towards these healthy practices could be developed by students. For example, imposing sports in schools or universities could label them as useless, and even be ignored by most children. Thus, forcibly applying such activities can have a negative impact on students. Second, explaining the benefits of a healthy and active lifestyle are proven to be more effective than obligating students to do such activities. Studies show that people tend to continue healthy practices given that they understand the benefits of them. As a way to illustrate this, including educational activities on how to include sports in students' daily life rather than forcibly integrating them in schools is more likely to ensure that they will continue living healthily, provided that they understand the usefullness of an active lifestyle. On the other hand, including sports activities in school can improve students' results. Research concluded that working out regularly, which can be achieved by including such activities in schools, can boost the results and the overall results of students. However, I do not find it appropriate to force children to undergo these kinds of activities. In conclusion, imposing sports activities for students is certainly not the most suitable way of leading them into healthy lifestyles. In spite of that, regular exercise could also be beneficial for the results of the students. ", "target": 9.0, "cefr": "C2", "essay_id": "essay_8d3a20376aa21f92", "split": "test", "n_edits": 1.0}

Therefore, I guess the vehicle will not be roadworthy in the near future. With driving no longer an option, my siblings and I have decided to go for a train journey. I already bought your ticket, so you won\u2019t have to worry about queuing at the ticket office the morning of our trip. Once we get to Milan, we will head to the Science Museum by metro. I can assure you, the journey will not take long. The museum headquarters is on the same line of the train station, so the second leg of the journey is going to take just eight minutes, give or take. The Science Museum we are going to visit is one of the largest scientific and technological museums in Italy. Visitors are given the chance to learn about scientific discoveries through interactive sessions and even experiment with materials and mechanical elements.  If you are interested in getting a taste of the event, the exhibition we are booked in is all about Artificial Intelligence. It is expected to display a collection of portraits drawn by the world's first robot artist. Though futuristic this exhibition may seem, it aims to prompt a large-scale debate about the rapid rise of AI technology and to analyse the relationship between humans and technology. What whetted my curiosity about this exhibition is the fact that the drawings on display are the work of a robot artist, a human-like machine that has been built by a team of programmers, roboticists, art experts and psychologists over a two-year period. I am looking forward to immersing myself in this virtual environment because I feel this topic is fully contemporary. I guess we will have a whale of a time! As I said above, there is no need for you to buy train or subway tickets. I have already bought them. Just to be on the safe side, bring a camera with you. Unfortunately, my camera is on its last legs and, therefore, pretty unreliable. I will not want to risk going back home without photos of this once-in-a-lifetime exhibition! See you on Saturday!

A calm life is what everybody seeks and strives to have. Peace of mind and a healthy body are what a calm life offers. Why would I choose an intense and unsafe life while I can have a much better one for a long happy time!

Thanks to the incredible progress of medicine and the breakthroughs of technology, we, humans, can experience high quality living unlike our ancestors whose life was threatened by diseases, unmerciful plagues and prolong disastrous wars.

Do you agree? Write your **argumentative essay**.\n\nShould we introduce a mandatory sports activities to university students and school children?  This might be a difficult question, however, it is worth examining.  All the evidence suggests that an inactive lifestyle causes the negative effects on health.  A majority of people older than fifty suffers from some kind of chronic diseases, and most of them are not engaged in regular physical activities.  Only when people get older will they realize the importance of exercises.    In my personal view, exposing young people to more physical activity would be the most effective approach the authority could take to improve people's health status.  Therefore, I would definitely agree with mandating sports activities at least three times per week to all university students and school children.    Some people would argue that forcing young people to do physical activity detracts their freedom.  Other may claim that such mandatory program reduces studying time of children.  To a certain limited extent, there is some truth in these arguments.  However, the real situation is that young people would never lose their freedom, rather, they might find important hint on physical activities which they can carry on throughout their life.  In fact, three times per week would only be six hours out of thirty six hours of the whole weekly activity.  Any other academic studies can be achieved in the remaining hours.  I would also like to emphasize the favorable effect of mandatory program.  Children who already like physical activities will do various sports anyway.  It is the matter of children who opt out physical activities.  If they were not forced to do sports, how would they find the  fun of such activities?  Widening the range of opportunities in the early stage is essential to education.  To conclude, I would insist that young people should be engaged regularly in sports activities.  It would have more positive impact than negative effect. ", "target": 8.0, "cefr": "C1", "essay_id": "essay_2d6e27028d4a347b", "split": "test", "n_edits": 12.0}

In this review I would like to evaluate whether 'Write and Improve' is a useful resource for English learners or not.  The main features of this learning tool are written texts. Learners' skills are differentiated between the three levels: beginner, intermediate and advanced. This corresponds to the European Frame of Language Skills, A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, and C2. These are reasonable categories for a student to choose from in order to make faster progress. The focus is laid on distinguishing between the various written forms a student is confronted with in an exam, such as an essay, a letter, a review, and a proposal. Another focus is put on considering the formality and the author of a written piece must know how to choose the adequate vocabolary if he or she writes an informal or a formal letter. What I like on this tool is the feedback if I remembered the question or the task respectively. If the student has completely written about the question he will be rewarded with a 5. A bright yellow mark shows that something is stilistically not alright.   I would definitely recommend this clever tool to English learners. It allows one to enhance the ability to render English texts more quickly and without the temptation to use dictionaries. This tool is definitely able to improve the compository skills of an English student in a most comfortable way, at home and in an reasonable time.

{"input": "Because of the negative effects on health of an inactive lifestyle, all university students and school children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week. Do you agree? Write your **argumentative essay**.\n\nYes, I agree. I agree but actually I want, to add something to this opinion. I properly think that we should replace the words all university students and school children to all people across the world because not just only students, everyone should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week. Many people\u2019s health has been affected badly by their inactive lifestyle but they didn\u2019t know. Their inactive lifestyle is a summarize of bad things that could harm their health such as eating too much sugar and fast food or laziness to exercise. Except for exercise, they also needed to be careful with their diet every day if they want to have good health. They didn't need to be too strict, actually, they just need to be careful with their daily food calories, and nutrition. Nutrition was playing an indispensable role in the human body and health, it was like the rope keeping our life not pass away, it and calories are what keeps our bodies going every day. Although, they together keeping our bodies alive, they played different roles in our bodies.  Nutrition was keeping our organs, skin, hair, and either our bodies alive. Calories weren\u2019t less important than nutrition, they provided our organs, skin, and either energy to be active every day. We could get nutrition and calories from what we eat every day. Different food would provide you different nutrition and amount of calories to our body. For example, meat would give you energy and a big amount of calories so it was very hard to digest instead vegetable also give you energy but not too much like meat but it just has a little number of calories, and it also can help us digest. So eating different food every day except it helps we not anorexic, it also helps our bodies better. After all, we should care to watch the calories of our food because our body just needs a specific amount of calories, If you digested more calories than our body need, it can clump and turn into fat deposits in the blood vessel. It properly makes our body fatter. And it also affects the amount of blood flowing to the heart because if you don't exercise enough to reduce calories every day. There will be more and more fat deposits in the blood vessel and soon these fat deposits such much that it can prevent blood from the blood vessels flowing back to the hearth and it's one cause of many cause could lead to a dangerous disease that kills millions of people every year, heart attack. But don't worry, you just need to do exercise every day to help your body be healthy. ", "target": 6.5, "cefr": "B2", "essay_id": "essay_87ce660d0c2bf0ae", "split": "test", "n_edits": 43.0}

I\u2019d love to kick off the weekend by spending some quality time with you and catching up with all the latest news. You must fill me in on all the juicy gossip of your honeymoon! To mark the occasion, let me ask you over for dinner. I will be treating you with my favourite dish, which is also a true Italian classic: a comforting bowl of tagliatelle with bolognese sauce. As well as being family-friendly and easy to make, this recipe is a champion of versatility. What I like about this dish is the fact that I can always rely on it. Whether I am rustling up a meal in a busy midweek day or cooking to impress friends, tagliatelle with bolognese sauce is something I always turn to. It is a recipe for success! If I am up to my ears in work, I usually go for a classic bolognese sauce. What does it mean? I put onion, celery and carrots in a large pan, I cook them on high heat for five minutes until they are softened, and then I add the mince. After stirring it for five minutes with a wooden spoon, I add the passata. Then, I turn the heat down to medium, thus allowing the sauce to bubble away for 40 minutes. When the thick rag\u00f9 is ready, I bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil, drop in the pasta and cook it until Al dente. Finally, I put the pasta in a plate and top with bolognese sauce. If I am not too busy, I find it rewarding to upgrade my classic tagliatelle with new ingredients, such as smoked pancetta, dried porcini mushrooms and red wine vinegar. I have recently tried my hand at making a vegetable version of bolognese sauce, which seems to have gone down well with my husband. I\u2019d really love you to have a taste of my new culinary success because, as you know, I really value your feedback on my cooking. You cannot miss the chance to taste this healthy tagliatelle! I am sure it will make your mouth water. Tagliatelle with bolognese sauce is a recipe for every season. I usually get a real kick out of eating bolognese sauce on chilly Sundays, when the days in winter are short and grey. Eating tagliatelle with bolognese sauce in spring is a pleasure, too. In fact, March, April and May are the months in which my husband and I pamper ourselves with delicious Sunday meals under the blossoming patio in the garden.  I hope to have whetted your appetite!

I check background of my stay for example hotels, airports as well as connections guaranteed by public transport.  However, this time was different. It was magnificent time of being there.

I could not believe that buildings' foundations standing on the rock. The second scene of the town was the real touch of the history. I could not believe that the Finns have so good relations with neighbouring Russia, although they were involved in many conflicts with their Russian neighbours.

{"input": "Because of the negative effects on health of an inactive lifestyle, all university students and school children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week. Do you agree? Write your **argumentative essay**.\n\nMore and more young people lead an unhealthy lifestyle because of the lack of time or money. Is forcing them to become active at least 3 times per week and by that intruding their individual lifestyle a justifiable way to solve this problem? Firstly, both students and pupils have to invest a lot of time into studying for school or university. As a result, they are left with a minimum of leisure time. Prompting them to do sports during this remaining time is questionable, as it interferes with their private life. Also, it confines their liberty to choose how they want to spend their spare time, and definitely requires a second thought. Furthermore, whenever something is forced on people, it naturally becomes another burden to carry. Hence, doing sports becomes another task to be delivered. Originally, sports should provide a balance to work and enable the brain to recover and rebuild itself. As a matter of fact, not everyone is physically or mentally able to participate in the same types of sports as the majority of people. Suddenly, including everybody\u00b4s individual needs turns out to be a very complex issue. Solutions tailored to special requirements have to be found. For instance, people who are physically limited may need to be equipped with devices in order to participate in e.g. swimming or running. Protheses or artificial limbs are necessary to help these people join in. Yet, making them pay for these augmentations would be highly unfair and unethical. Summing up, I would absolutely dislike the idea of enforcement, as it limits students\u00b4 liberties and rights and excludes people with special needs. However, it would be advisable to enlargen the range of sports offered to students and pupils. More alternatives  to the classical types of sports from which to choose will encourage them to participate on a more liberal basis.

{"input": "Would you like to live a long, calm life until 100 years old or would you prefer a shorter life but much more intense. Decide and explain your reasons.\n\nNowadays, our biggest wish as humans is to live as many years as possible. The development of technology facilitates the medical treatments for curing people, assuring they are healthy, increasing the chance of living a longer life. But is it all about how many years we wander around in this world? To begin with, at the end of our lives, we don't concentrate on how many years we have lived. Many cultural figures, such as Abraham Lincoln, have exemplified this concept. One of his most famous quotes is 'in the end it's not the years in your life that count; it's the life in your years\u201d. Memories, emotions, and feelings develop us as human beings, thus living more spiritually. Not only do they increase the intensity of a moment, but they also create more powerful memories than the ones of somebody who might choose to live a calmer life. To a further extent, embedding people with cherished memories increases the intensity of those moments, thus we become more attached to the ones we love. Living a longer life comes at the cost of seeing our close friends and relatives die. Usually, sudden death sorrows the relatives and close friends. Our beloved people live as long as we remember them. They are forever with us, banishing the sorrow that was brought together with their physical absence.

Do you agree? Write your **argumentative essay**.\n\nNowadays, sedentarism affects most students who decide to adopt an inactive lifestyle. It has a negative impact on our health, thus increasing the chances of contracting mortal diseases. Technology provides different ways of communication. Writing messages is a common technique that everybody uses in our epoch. Our eyesight suffers from this consequence, damaging faster than it has been in the past. But is it that difficult to connect with nature? I consider every student should be forced to do as many sports activities as possible. To begin with, an active lifestyle immunizes our bodies, protecting ourselves from different species of viruses. The contact with nature exposes us to multiple variants of bacteria that trigger our immune system to fight against them, albeit not being harmful to humans. Not only does an active lifestyle protect us from getting ill, but it also increases the quality of our sleep. Scientists proved that people who spend their time doing outdoor activities wake up feeling revitalized, no matter how turbulent their sleep was. Secondly, our health is affected spiritually. We forget how to socialize with each other. Connections between humans are established in an online environment, relying on an app to transmit a specific message. Taking part in a team sport helps in increasing awareness of others' feelings, thus developing communication skills. If I would have known that I can understand better my friends after taking part in these activities, I would have joined my local football team years ago. Not only do they increase awareness of how others are feeling, but sports also bring serenity and composure into our lives, concepts that are essential for our mental health. Concluding, doing sports activities in a school is beneficial for the students. I don't consider that, with 3 times per week, this represents an exhausting activity that overwhelms the children.", "target": 8.0, "cefr": "C1", "essay_id": "essay_4ab3c837d62fa27d", "split": "test", "n_edits": 7.0}

Respected Sir,  This is to inform you about the opinion of the Council of Men on the proposal of mobile ban in public places.  The Council of Men sincerely disagree with this idea for a number of reasons. Mobile phones have become an essential part of our daily lives. People rely on their digital assistant for the completion of their chores. Some of them keep in touch with their old parents and monitor their activity via their mobile phones. Others have office work, children to take care of and their entire social life in their mobile phones. Thus, a complete ban on mobile phones in public places will not be beneficial and will lead to public outrage.  To avoid such an outcome, we propose an alternative of limiting the usage. We can limit the time spent on the mobile phones to thirty minutes in a public place. Thirty minutes is enough for checking upon their children, elderly parents and for sorting their office work. The remaining time can be spent on interacting with others instead of hiding behind their screens. This solution will not only build upon the intention behind the original bill, but also take care of the health and growth of the public.  With people priortizing their tasks on their mobiles, we can expect to see a more lively crowd in the restaurants. I request you to go through our proposal and then make your decision.

It could be listening in every moment and for every situation. I want to write about an experience in my life. When I was a child I was very fond of the music world, at first instance, I loved listening to only Mexican traditional music, now I hate it!  Some years later I started to study at the elementary school. I went to a private college where English was a mandatory subject, so every day I had to take an English lesson, we studied some grammar rules, and vocabulary, I tried to improve my writing and speaking skills but every Friday it was different. My English teacher put her horn on and listened to English music, I started to follow some British rock bands like 'The Beatles', 'REM' and 'The Doors'. It was a great tool to improve my listening skills, all my classmates and I translate the letter of the song, we learned it by heart and, after that sang and had a ravishing time together.   At this moment, music is still part of my English studies, every day I learn new vocabulary and idioms of this challenging language.  Another moment in my life when music is so important is when I work out, I like to have my body in shape so I am used to working out at least five times per week. When I do exercise I love listening to electronic music, it motivates me and I can have a better performance.  In a word and to answer your last question, it is impossible for me to think about a world without music because music is a universal language where you can show a feeling like happiness, sadness, and so on.", "target": 6.5, "cefr": "B2", "essay_id": "essay_816d2cdf157df76a", "split": "test", "n_edits": 17.0}

How would you teach why is important to take care of the nature to children if you don't show them the animals that they must protect? It's important for all of us to know more to the animal world, to be close to the animals, in order to learn about them and love them more. Besides, the kids love going to the zoo, and their trips at the zoo is a wonderful way for them to learn and have some fun. I think that the real issue is how the animals are looked after in zoos. If they're good places, with enough food and clean water, with enough space to run and make their lives, and with professional veterinarians who take care of the animals, I don't see the problem. However, it's true that in many places on the world, zoos aren't perfect places to the animals. Furthermore, in many zoos are so many animals that it's impossible for their owners to take care of them. So, I think that we must insist on better coditions for the animals who are in the zoos.", "target": 6.5, "cefr": "B2", "essay_id": "essay_ac06f3b72f1d5716", "split": "test", "n_edits": 17.0}

However, I don't do the same things every day. I like playing video games since I was a child. I'm used to playing video games at least ten or fifteen minutes daily. I think this is a wonderful way to relax: If I have had a hard and stressful day, I can always find relaxation and peace killing some aliens or driving fast a car in a video game. On the other hand, I really like to do exercise. I didn't use to do exercise, but a few months ago I started to do it and it was wonderful. I feel really well, and I've lost some weight even! Besides, I really like to go out for a walk with my dogs. I have two dogs right now, and they're marvelous. One is pretty old, but the other one is young, and he always want to play with me. The two of them are very affectionate, and they're always behind me, looking for a caress from me.

{"input": "Write about a holiday that you went on that was really important to you. Say where you went and what you saw, and explain why it was the best holiday you ever had.\n\nWell, I think that my best holiday was during the last summer. This wasn't only for the destination, but for how I was then. Last year was horrible for me. I had a lot of stress at work, but also something worse happended: my mother had a strock. I was there when that happened, and it was terrible. I was really terrified. My mother survived, but she had to do rehabilitation for many months. At the beginning she was very weak and dizzy, and I was alone to look after her. She didn't improve on teraphy until her doctors found that she has depression and anxiety. They gave her some medication, and she started to improve quickly. For this summer she was much better, almost like before the stroke. However, I was exhausted mental and physically. Besides, my work contract had finished. So I was in a moment of change on my life, but without any energy to face it. So, some friends suggested to me to go on a vacation for my own, in order to spend time with myself and recover energies. I wasn't sure at first, but they were totally right. I went for a week to a wonderful place at the coast, and it was healthy for my soul.", "target": 6.5, "cefr": "B2", "essay_id": "essay_abf5d2f273968198", "split": "test", "n_edits": 22.0}
{"input": "You have had a class discussion on the importance of exercise. Now your teacher has asked you to write a composition answering the following question: _Exercise is important for our health, but are there things that are more important?_ Write your composition.\n\nYes, of course. However, we need to be healthy in order to have a quality of life that allows us to enjoy our lives, and do exercise is a great way to do this. So, is it important to exercise? Yes, but this can't keep us to do other things more important. I've recently started to do exercise in order to be more healthy. I already have thirty years, so I need to be more careful with my health. The truth is I feel great doing exercise, both physically and mentally. I've lost some weight even. However, despite the fact that I exercise, I haven't stopped to eat sweets, pies and pizzas, because I really love that kind of food. Of course, I don't eat those things every day. I've actually made some changes in my diet: I try to eat two pieces of fruit everyday at least. Besides, my dinners are more light: vegetables, purees, grilled fish, salads, this kind of things. And I'm trying to stop eating bread at night. However, I don't want to obsess about be healthy. If one day I want to buy some pie, I'll do it. However, I try to do this punctually, in a special day or something similar. ", "target": 6.5, "cefr": "B2", "essay_id": "essay_960c54cb69725585", "split": "test", "n_edits": 21.0}

In what ways might it still be the same? The writer of the best article will win a prize! Write your article.\n\nWell, that's a difficult question. I's obvious that the forms and ways of travel will continue to change. We only need to think about how we travel only thirty years ago. We have new means of transport and, undoubtetly, faster than the precedents. If this continue, it's obvious that there will be many different was to travel. However, the different will be determined by how the technology and the environment evolve. If we don't discover new energy resources in order to replace coal, gas and oil, our current means of transport won't be useful anymore. On the other hand, if the environment crisis continue, we should apply raddical actions to reduce pollution, which could determinate how we travel. I can't say how we'll travel in the future, but what I can say without any doubt is that we need to become more aware of the Earth's limits. We should try harder to reduce the use of pollutings means of transport, and start to use public transportation or bykes instead. I personally don't have my own car, and always use buses, the underground and trains to travel.", "target": 7.0, "cefr": "B2+", "essay_id": "essay_6026407acdafe3d2", "split": "test", "n_edits": 18.0}
